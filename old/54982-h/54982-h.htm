<p>I have carefully revised this book for the sixth
edition, and have made those changes and additions
that have been rendered necessary by the increase of
our knowledge of gynecology.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>I have written this book for the medical student. I
have attempted to present the best teaching of modern
gynecology, untrammelled by antiquated theories or
methods of treatment. I have, in most instances, recommended
but one plan of treatment for each disease, hoping
in this way to avoid confusing the student or the
physician who consults the book for practical guidance.
I have, as a rule, omitted all facts of anatomy, physiology,
and pathology which may be found in the general
text-books upon these subjects. Such facts have
been mentioned in detail only when it seemed important
for the elucidation of the subject, or when there were
certain points in the pathology that were peculiar to the
diseases under consideration. I am indebted to Dr. H.
D. Beyea for several pathological drawings, and to Dr.
Wm. R. Nicholson for the preparation of the Index.</p>

DISEASES OF WOMEN.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3 id="THE_GENERAL_CAUSES_OF_DISEASES_OF_WOMEN">THE GENERAL CAUSES OF DISEASES OF WOMEN.</h3>

<p>Gynecology is the study of diseases peculiar to
women. As woman possesses organs which man has
not, and as the parts&mdash;physiological and social&mdash;that
she plays in life differ from those played by man, we
should expect to find her afflicted with a certain number
of diseases, peculiar to her, which are dependent
upon her anatomy, physiology, and mode of life. Such
diseases occur in barbarous as well as in civilized
women; and similar diseases, peculiar to the female,
occur in the lower animals. Thus, in the cow and the
mare we find tumors of the vagina, prolapse of the vagina
and uterus, fibroid tumors, sarcoma and cancer of the
uterus, and some forms of ovarian cysts. Cysts of the
tubes and the ovaries are exceedingly common in old
mares; cats and goats are similarly affected.</p>

<p>From a pathological point of view, however, the civilized
woman unfortunately differs from her barbarous
sister, and from the female of the lower animals, in many
important particulars. She is more liable to the pathological
conditions which, more or less, all females have
in common. These conditions appear in a more severe
form, and are followed by more disastrous results, in
the civilized than in the barbarous state.</p>

<p>The female among the lower animals and among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
savages seems to be about equal in proportionate
strength and physical endurance to the male, though
in size and in gross muscular strength she may be his
inferior. Her subordinate position is often due not so
much to any difference in strength as to the fact that
the male possesses weapons&mdash;as the horns of the deer&mdash;with
which nature has not endowed the female; and
though she is liable to more diseases than the male,
yet her relative position does not seem to be materially
altered by this fact. The bitch is as enduring as the
dog. The female grizzly is as ferocious and as dangerous
as the male. The mare is as fast as the horse.
The squaw among the American Indians can lift and
carry burdens which the lazy buck would not attempt.</p>

<p>How different it is with the civilized woman, as we
know her in this country! The average healthy woman
in this country is very much inferior in physical strength
and endurance to the average man, and this inferiority
is tremendously increased when she becomes sick from
any of the diseases to which her sex is liable.</p>

<p>The increased liability of the civilized woman to disease
is in a large measure due to her poor physique.
But this is not all.</p>

<p>The causes of many of the diseases with which the
gynecologist has to deal cannot be traced so easily.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors of the uterus, which are so common
among the colored women of this country, are said by
Tait to be unknown among their African cousins, who
are removed by but a few generations.</p>

<p>The most common causes of diseases of women are
injuries received during parturition; sepsis; venereal diseases;
errors of development; improper mode of life and
clothing during the period of development; neglect during
menstruation; and celibacy.</p>

<p>The results of the injuries received during parturition
are most numerous. They may appear immediately, a
short time after labor, or at some remote period. The
disabilities attending laceration through the sphincter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
ani or a recto-vaginal or vesico-vaginal fistula appear
before the mother leaves her bed. The suffering from
a laceration of the cervix, a subinvolution of the uterus,
or a retrodisplacement may not be felt for some weeks
or months after labor; while the still more remote result,
the development of cancer, may not appear for
many years, though it can be positively traced to the
lesion in the cervix as the primary cause.</p>

<p>Septic infection of the genital tract kills or makes
invalids of many women. The infection occurs at the
time of a miscarriage or of a normal labor, or it may be
acquired from the dirty instruments or the dirty hands
of a physician. It is not a cause of disease among civilized
women alone, but occurs among barbarous and
semi-barbarous races.</p>

<p>Venereal disease, especially gonorrhea, has been said
to be the most common cause of disease among women.
The disease extends from the external genitals through
the uterus and Fallopian tubes, causing sterility, chronic
invalidism, and death from peritonitis.</p>

<p>Errors of development are frequent causes of disease
and suffering among women. Atresia of the vagina or
of the cervix uteri, by causing retention of the uterine
discharges, produces most serious pathological conditions.
Arrested development of the whole or of part of the
uterus is a common cause of disease.</p>

<p>Improper clothing and an improper mode of life during
the period of development are most fertile sources of
diseases of women. Clothing which contracts the waist,
as well as clothing which, though not unduly tight in
the inactive state, yet interferes with abdominal respiration
during activity, is most injurious. Such clothing
diminishes the capacity of inspiration by restricting abdominal
expansion, and thus crowds down the pelvic
organs toward the pelvic floor; and the continuous support
to the abdominal walls diminishes their natural
muscular strength and places the woman in a condition
predisposing to the various displacements of the uterus.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>An improper mode of life, irregular hours for sleeping
and eating, insufficient exercise, and lack of fresh air and
sun, resulting in poor muscular development, seem to
predispose the woman, as the man, to a variety of pathological
conditions; but as the reproductive apparatus in
woman is more delicately organized, and as, during the
period of active life, this is really her chief part, it more
especially suffers as a result of any general systemic
derangement.</p>

<p>Neglect during menstruation, especially in the young
girl, is a frequent cause of subsequent suffering. The
effect of menstruation upon the whole system is remarkable.
The nervous, vascular, and digestive systems all
share in the menstrual function. The usual work of the
girl at school or other employment should be altered to
suit the altered conditions of her body at the menstrual
period. Long school hours and close mental application
or active exercise are too often continued at this time.</p>

<p>Celibacy is an unnatural state and a common cause of
disease. Certain forms of fibroid tumors of the uterus
are more common in single than in married women, and
more common in sterile than in childbearing women.
And the painful cirrhotic ovaries of the old maid are the
result of the unceasing menstrual congestions never
relieved by pregnancy and lactation.

<h3 id="METHODS_OF_EXAMINATION">METHODS OF EXAMINATION.</h3>

<p>In order to make a complete gynecological examination,
we must examine the abdomen, the external organs
of generation, and the pelvic structures.</p>

<p><b id="EXAMINATION_OF_THE_ABDOMEN">Examination of the Abdomen.</b>&mdash;In order to make
a perfectly satisfactory examination of the abdomen, the
woman should be in bed, with all clothing removed except
the undershirt and the night-dress, which should be
drawn well up above the costal margin. Examination
made with any constricting clothing about the waist or
about the lower thorax is most unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>The abdomen is examined by inspection, palpation,
percussion, and auscultation.</p>

<p>The woman should lie flat upon her back, and the
abdomen should be thoroughly exposed. We can then
determine by <i>inspection</i> the presence of dilated veins or
of lineæ albicantes, the general size and form of the
abdomen, the occurrence of any abdominal movement,
and the presence of any asymmetry in the abdominal
contour, such as would be made by the bulge of a tumor
or the displacement of an abdominal organ. The shape
of the abdomen, even though symmetrical, is often diagnostic
of certain intra-abdominal conditions. Thus, an
abdominal enlargement that is due merely to fat presents
a different contour from the enlargement caused by tympanitic
distention of the intestine. The enlargement due
to ascites, or free fluid in the peritoneum, differs in contour
from that caused by an encysted collection of fluid.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that lineæ albicantes are not
always the result of pregnancy, but that they may have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
been caused by distention of the abdomen from some
other cause.</p>

<p><i>Palpation.</i>&mdash;We can determine most by palpation of
the abdomen. The examiner should always remember
that it is most important to secure the patient’s confidence,
and to proceed so gently, slowly, and gradually
in performing palpation that no voluntary or reflex contraction
of the abdominal muscles may impede his manipulations.</p>

<p>In cases in which there is a sore or tender spot within
the abdomen the contraction of the recti muscles may be
altogether involuntary, persisting even when the patient
is anesthetized. We see this in the rigid right rectus
muscle of appendicitis. The hands should be warmed,
and palpation should be performed with both hands. A
certain amount of gentle stroking or massage of the
abdomen will secure the patient’s confidence by making
her feel that she will not be hurt by any sudden violent
pressure, and will also prevent reflex contraction of the
muscles. By proceeding in this way, slowly, the examiner
can palpate the whole of the abdominal surface,
exploring first the structures lying most anterior, and
then, pressing the fingers more deeply, he can examine
the more posterior structures.</p>

<p>Fluctuation in an encysted fluid accumulation is generally
readily determined. While one hand is placed
against one side of the fluid mass and the opposite side
is percussed by the fingers of the other hand, the wave
of fluctuation is easily felt. Sometimes a thrill or a false
wave of fluctuation is observed in the subcutaneous fat
of obese women. This disturbing element may, however,
be eliminated by an assistant pressing the ulnar
edge of his hand in the median line upon the abdominal
surface, thus stopping the fat wave of fluctuation.</p>

<p>Special organs in the abdomen sometimes require
special methods of examination. It is very often necessary
for the gynecologist to examine the kidneys, because
many women have movable or floating kidneys, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
nervous, gastric, and abdominal symptoms may be due
to this condition. The presence of a floating kidney
may often be determined by inspection; the presence of a
movable kidney, however, must be determined by palpation.
This should be performed with the woman in the
sitting, or standing, erect posture; or sitting upon the
edge of a chair, with the body inclined somewhat forward
and the hands upon the knees; or lying upon a bed,
on the side opposite the kidney that is being examined.
One hand should be placed over the lumbar muscles; the
other hand should be placed upon the anterior abdominal
wall immediately below the costal margin, and should
be pressed backward. If the kidney lies below its normal
position, it may in this way be brought between the
two hands, and can be felt to glide upward as the hands
are pressed together. In case a movable kidney cannot
readily be found, because it may have returned to its
normal position, it may often be brought down again if
the woman is made to cough.</p>

<p>In a thin woman the vermiform appendix may sometimes
be felt through the abdominal wall; and in cases
of pain and inflammation in the right iliac region it is
sometimes important to determine whether or not the
trouble has started in the vermiform appendix or in the
Fallopian tube. In order to palpate the vermiform appendix
the examiner should stand upon the right side
of the woman, who is lying upon her back, and should
place the tips of the fingers of the right hand at about
the junction of the upper and middle thirds of a line
drawn from the middle of Poupart’s ligament to the umbilicus.
By pressing backward firmly and gently, pulsations
of the right common iliac artery may be felt;
and then by drawing the hand directly outward it will
pass over the different structures in this region lying
between the palpating hand and the posterior abdominal
wall. The appendix may often be felt, especially
if it is indurated by inflammation.</p>

<p><i>Percussion</i> of the abdomen should be performed with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
the woman in the dorsal position; though, if the examiner
suspects the presence of free fluid in the peritoneum,
or ascites, much may be learned by percussing in different
positions and noting the accompanying changes in
the percussion-note.</p>

<p>Percussion should then be performed with the woman
upon her back, upon the right side, upon the left side,
sitting up, and upon the hands and knees. An encysted
fluid accumulation will give practically the same result
in percussion in all positions, while free fluid will gravitate
to the most dependent portion.</p>

<p><i>Auscultation</i> of the abdomen is best performed with
the stethoscope. By it we may hear fetal heart-sounds,
uterine souffle, placental bruit, peritoneal friction sounds,
and the peristaltic sounds of the intestinal tract. All
of these sounds are of importance, and the presence or
absence of any of them may have an important bearing
upon the diagnosis of the case.</p>

<p><b id="EXAMINATION_OF_THE_EXTERNAL_GENITALS_AND_PELVIC_STRUCTURES">Examination of External Genitals and Pelvic
Structures.</b>&mdash;To examine the external organs of generation
and the pelvic viscera the woman should be placed
upon a table. In some cases the physician may be
obliged, for want of proper facilities or on account of
the physical condition of the patient, to make his examination
upon a bed. Such an examination, however,
is never so satisfactory or so thorough as the examination
made with the woman upon the examining-table.
A great number of gynecological tables have been introduced.
The one which seems to the writer the best, on
account of its simplicity and the perfect relaxation of
the abdominal muscles furnished by it, is shown in the
accompanying illustration (<a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). It is a plain wooden
table, at the foot of which are attached the upright supports
for holding the stirrups for the feet, such as have
been devised by Dr. Edebohls. By this arrangement the
feet and legs are supported without any effort on the part
of the woman; when the buttocks are drawn well down
to the foot of the table there is a certain amount of flexion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
of the pelvis upon the trunk, and the most complete
attainable relaxation of the abdominal muscles is secured.</p>

<p>When the woman has been placed in this position the
examiner should investigate thoroughly, and in order, the
following structures: The anus, the perineum, the labia
majora, the nymphæ, the
fourchette, the orifices of
the ducts of the vulvo-vaginal
glands, the hymen
or its remains, the vestibule
and the small glands of the
vestibule, the external urinary
meatus, and the clitoris.</p>

<p>To determine any pathological
condition of these
structures it is necessary
that the physician should
be familiar with the appearance
in the normal woman,
and to gain such essential
knowledge we should avail
ourselves of every opportunity
offered to make a critical
examination of the external genitals of women, going
over all the different structures in order.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_1" src="images/fig_1.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Woman in the dorsal position
with feet supported in Edebohls’
stirrups.</p></div>

<p><b id="VAGINAL_AND_BIMANUAL_EXAMINATION">Vaginal and Bimanual Examination.</b>&mdash;Having examined
and noted the condition of the external genitals,
the physician should next proceed to examine the vagina.
The index finger of the right or the left hand
should be gently introduced into the vagina. The condition
of the vaginal walls, and the direction, consistency,
form, etc. of the vaginal cervix, may be determined.
The shape and size of the os uteri should be noted.
The ulnar edge and the tips of the fingers of the other
hand should then be placed upon the abdomen, immediately
above the symphysis pubis, and gently pressed
backward and downward toward the vaginal finger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
(<a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>). In this way the various pelvic organs, the
uterus, Fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ureters, may be
palpated between the two hands, and their position,
size, shape, and consistency may be determined. Such
an examination is, of course, made much more easily
in a thin woman than in a fat one. A thin woman a
few weeks after labor may be examined most easily, on
account of the relaxation of the abdominal and vaginal
walls.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_2" src="images/fig_2.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Bimanual examination.</p></div>

<p>This is called the bimanual method of examination,
and the student will find that as he acquires practice in
this method he will gradually depend less upon examination
by the uterine sound and the speculum, and will
rely altogether upon his sense of touch, his ability to
palpate.</p>

<p>It matters not which hand be used in making the vaginal
examination. It will, however, be found that the
hand that is used the more frequently will become the
more proficient.</p>

<p>In making the bimanual examination the structures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
should be palpated methodically in order. The vaginal
finger notes the condition of the cervix uteri. If the
fundus be in the normal position, the uterus can then be
taken between the abdominal hand (upon the fundus) and
the vaginal finger (upon the cervix) (<a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>). The shape,
size, mobility, and consistency are noted. The vaginal
finger is then passed anteriorly and laterally toward either
uterine cornu, while the abdominal fingers pass over to
the posterior aspect of the same cornu. The ovarian
ligament and the proximal end of the Fallopian tube
may thus be felt. Passing farther outward, the whole of
the tube and the ovary may be examined. The same
procedure is then applied to the opposite side.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_3" src="images/fig_3.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Bimanual examination; median sagittal section of the pelvis.</p></div>

<p>The condition of the ureters may be determined by
placing the vaginal finger in either lateral vaginal fornix
and drawing it outward and forward, when these structures
will pass over the end of the finger. When the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
ureters are indurated by inflammation they can be plainly
felt.</p>

<p>By the method of examination here advised the physician
will always make a visual examination before making
a digital one. There are several advantages derived
from this procedure. In the first place, no examination
of a woman is thorough unless a careful visual examination
of the external genitals has been made. The discovery
of discharges and of lesions of the external genitals
may throw much light upon the condition found higher up
in the pelvis. Again, the examiner protects himself. A
great many unfortunate cases of syphilis have been acquired
by physicians from a primary sore upon the examining
finger. A preliminary visual examination enables
one to guard against this danger. The primary sore
occurs upon the end of the examining finger or upon the
web between the index and middle fingers&mdash;the part of
the hand that is pressed against the fourchette.</p>

<p>The hands of the physician should, of course, be surgically
clean before making an examination, and the grease
or oil which is used as a lubricant should be clean. The
hands should always be washed, after separating the parts
to make the visual examination, before the finger is thrust
into the vessel containing the lubricant. It is best to
place a small portion of the lubricant on a plate or a
saucer for each individual patient, and thus avoid the
danger of contaminating the rest. Carbolized oil, borated
vaseline or cosmoline, and a thick sterile solution of soap
are good lubricants. Neutral green soap diluted with
boiled water to the consistency of thin jelly is a very
agreeable lubricant which may easily be washed from the
hands and the vagina.</p>

<p>If practicable, the woman should receive a vaginal
douche of bichloride-of-mercury solution, 1:4000, and
the vulva should be washed, before making a bimanual
examination. The examiner should always clean the
external genitals of all discharges before introducing the
vaginal finger. In this way we avoid the danger of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
carrying septic material from the external genitals to the
upper portion of the genital tract. This preliminary
cleansing is not desirable before the external genitals
have been examined; for much may be learned from
observation of the discharges which bathe or escape from
the various structures. If practicable, a cleansing vaginal
douche of bichloride-of-mercury solution should be administered
after the bimanual examination.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_4" src="images/fig_4.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Double tenaculum.</p></div>

<p>The examination of the uterus and other pelvic structures
is often facilitated by dragging the uterus downward
with a tenaculum while the vaginal or the bimanual
examination is being made. Sensation in the cervix is
so slight that little or no pain is experienced in this procedure.
The anterior or posterior lip of the cervix is
caught with the single or the double tenaculum (<a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>),
guided along the vaginal finger or introduced through
the speculum, and the uterus is drawn down by an assistant
in case the bimanual examination is being made, or
by the external hand of the examiner in case a simple vaginal
examination is made. When this is done the utero-sacral
ligaments are made tense, and can be felt like two
cords extending from the sides of the cervix outward and
backward to the pelvic wall. The posterior surface of
the uterus can be palpated often as high up as the fundus.
The method is especially useful when the examination is
made by the rectum, and in this way the whole posterior
surface and the fundus of the uterus may be palpated
(<a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>The contraindications to a vaginal examination are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
virginity, the presence of a hymen, and any acute inflammatory
or painful condition of the vulva or vagina.
None of these conditions, however, forbid an examination
if an exact diagnosis is essential to the proper treatment
of the case, and can be made only in this way. It
may be that in these cases a rectal examination will be
sufficient for diagnosis.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_5" src="images/fig_5.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Bimanual examination with one finger in the rectum. The uterus is
drawn down with the double tenaculum.</p></div>

<p>Rectal examination of the pelvic structures is made in
a way similar to that already described for the vaginal
examination. Bimanual examination may be made by
palpating the various organs between the rectal finger
and the abdominal hand.</p>

<p><i>The Vaginal Speculum.</i>&mdash;The speculum is an instrument
through which a visual examination is made of the
vagina, the external os uteri, and the vaginal cervix. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
great number of specula have been invented. At the
present day the best two instruments of this class are
the bivalve speculum, such as Goodell’s (<a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>), and
the duck-bill speculum (<a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a>), or perineal retractor,
invented by Sims.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_6" src="images/fig_6.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Goodell’s speculum.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_7" src="images/fig_7.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Sims’ speculum.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_8" src="images/fig_8.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Sims’ depressor for the anterior vaginal wall.</p></div>

<p>The bivalve speculum is introduced with the woman
upon her back, in the dorso-sacral position already described.
The vulva and the vagina should be cleaned.
The speculum should be warmed by placing it in hot
water, and should then be lubricated with the soap solution
or with vaseline. It should be introduced with the
blades closed and the plane of the blades lying not exactly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
in the median sagittal plane of the body, but inclined
at a small acute angle to this plane, one edge of the
speculum being directed toward either vaginal sulcus.
The instrument is passed into the vagina toward the position
in which, by a previous digital examination, the vaginal
cervix had been found to lie. The instrument is then
turned with the handles toward either thigh, so that the
blades become parallel to the anterior and posterior vaginal
walls, in order that, when separated, they will open
the vaginal slit. The handles are brought together and
the blades opened. When the vaginal cervix comes
well into view the blades are fixed in place by the screws
(<a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_9" src="images/fig_9.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>&mdash;Goodell’s speculum in position.</p></div>

<p>In some cases, where the cervix points well forward
or well backward, it may be readily brought into view
through the speculum by catching it with a tenaculum.</p>

<p>By means of the bivalve speculum we are able to make
a partial inspection of the vaginal walls, an imperfect
inspection of the vaginal vault, and a good inspection
of the vaginal cervix and the external os. Applications
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
can be made to the cervix, but none of the minor operations
of gynecology can be performed through this
speculum.</p>

<p>The Sims speculum enables us to make the most thorough
inspection of the vagina, the vaginal vault, and the
vaginal cervix. The Sims speculum is merely a hook or
retractor for the perineum, and may be introduced with
the woman in the dorsal position, the Sims position, or
the genu-pectoral position. If the Sims speculum is
introduced in the dorso-sacral position, it is necessary
to hold forward the anterior vaginal wall in order to
obtain a view of the cervix.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_10" src="images/fig_10.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;The Sims position.</p></div>

<p>The Sims position, which is also called the latero-abdominal
position, is shown in <a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10</a>. The woman
is placed on the bed or table upon her left side. The
side of the face is upon the pillow; the left arm is behind
the back, so that the left breast rests upon the table.
The thighs are flexed upon the abdomen at an angle of
about 90° to the trunk. The right thigh is more flexed
than the left, so that the right knee may touch the table
above the left knee. The legs are flexed on the thighs.
In this position there is a tendency for the intestines,
following the force of gravity, to fall from the pelvis,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
and for the uterus and other pelvic viscera to be drawn
up. When the perineum is retracted with the blade of
the Sims speculum, air will enter the vagina and the
vaginal slit will become distended (<a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>). To facilitate
inspection of the cervix it is usually necessary also
to push forward the anterior abdominal wall by some
kind of depressor, such as the one shown in <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_11" src="images/fig_11.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;The cervix uteri exposed with the Sims speculum.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_12" src="images/fig_12.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;The knee-chest position.</p></div>

<p>The genu-pectoral position or the knee-chest position is
shown in <a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a>. The side of the face is upon the pillow;
the breast is upon the table; the thighs are vertical. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
this position the intestines fall from the pelvis, and the
other pelvic viscera are drawn upward by the force of
gravity. If the anus is opened, air rushes in and distends
the rectum. If the perineum is retracted, air
enters and distends the vagina. If the urethra is opened,
the bladder is likewise distended. The position is the
most useful one for inspection of the rectum, vagina and
vaginal cervix, and the bladder.</p>

<p>The Sims speculum, with the woman in the dorsal, the
Sims, or the knee-chest position, is the most useful instrument
by which to expose the cervix uteri for any of
the minor operations of gynecology. The manipulations
of the operator are not hampered by working between
metal walls.</p>

<p><b id="EXAMINATION_OF_THE_RECTUM">Examination of the Rectum.</b>&mdash;If the woman is
placed in the knee-chest position, a most satisfactory
inspection of the whole of the rectum may be made.
The woman should be placed in this position with the
buttocks before a good light, and the posterior margin
of the anus should be retracted by the small blade of a
Sims speculum; the rectum will immediately become
distended with air and the rectal walls will be well exposed.
Or the rectal specula (Figs. 13, 14) may be used.
In employing the longer of these instruments it is best
to use light reflected from a head-mirror or thrown
directly from an electric head-light into the speculum.</p>

<table class="dual">
  <tr>
    <td><img id="fig_13" src="images/fig_13.jpg" alt="" /></td>
    <td><img id="fig_14" src="images/fig_14.jpg" alt="" /></td>

    <td><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;Rectal speculum, small size.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The instrument should always be introduced for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
first two inches with the obturator in place. The obturator
should then be withdrawn and the speculum pushed
farther in, the operator watching and guiding its course
around the rectal valves or folds of mucous membrane,
so as to prevent injury to the walls of
the rectum. Anesthesia is not necessary
for this procedure.</p>

<p><b id="EXAMINATION_OF_THE_BLADDER">Examination of the Bladder.</b>&mdash;It
will readily be understood that all the hollow
viscera are much more easily examined
when their walls are separated by distention
with air than when the walls are collapsed.
The bladder is most readily examined in
this way. The woman should be placed
in the knee-chest position, or in the dorsal
position with the hips elevated above the
abdomen. In either position the intestines
fall from the pelvis, and when the urethra
is opened air enters and distends the bladder.
This distention is most certainly accomplished
in the knee-chest position. In
women who are not very fat, however, the
extreme dorso-sacral position is equally good.
The details of this method of examination
are described on a later page.</p>

<p><i>The uterine sound</i> is an instrument by
which the length of the uterine cavity may
be determined (<a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15</a>). The sound, which
is a large surgical probe, somewhat curved
to adapt itself to the normal shape of the
uterine axis, is made of pliable metal, so
that the curvature may be changed readily
to suit any case. The sound is graduated,
and at a position of 2½ inches from the tip is a small
elevation marking the length of the normal uterine
cavity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_15" src="images/fig_15.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>&mdash;Uterine
sound.</p></div>

<p>The uterine sound was at one time used a great deal to
determine the length and direction of the uterus, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
perhaps to assist in determining the character of the
uterine contents or of the endometrium. With our
present methods of examination, however, the sound is
of but little if any use. The size and direction of the
uterus can in nearly all cases be determined by bimanual
examination. The use of the uterine sound is by no
means free from danger. Many cases of septic endometritis
and salpingitis have been caused by it, and the
physician has often unintentionally committed an abortion
by passing the sound in a pregnant woman. The
uterine sound should never be used in a routine way. It
should never be used unless one expects to determine
with it something that cannot be determined by simpler
methods of examination.</p>

<p>The most thorough aseptic precautions should be observed
when the sound is introduced. The vulva, vagina,
and cervix should be cleaned and the sound should be
sterilized. The sound should never be introduced if
there is any suspicion of pregnancy.</p>

<p><b id="ANTISEPSIS">ANTISEPSIS</b>&mdash;In all examinations the physician should
observe every precaution to avoid carrying infection from
one patient to another. All instruments used in the examination
should be thoroughly cleansed with soap and
warm water, and then boiled for five minutes in a 1-per
cent. solution of carbonate of soda.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3 id="DISEASES_OF_THE_EXTERNAL_GENITALS">DISEASES OF THE EXTERNAL GENITALS.</h3>

<p><b id="VULVITIS">Vulvitis.</b>&mdash;Vulvitis, or inflammation of the vulva, is
not a common disease. The vulva is composed of several
parts which are anatomically distinct, and, though all
these parts are usually involved in an acute attack of
inflammation of the vulva, yet the symptoms of the disease
and the pathological appearance depend to a great
extent upon the structures which are principally affected.
The labia majora, the nymphæ, the vestibule with its
mucous crypts or glands, the clitoris, the external urinary
meatus, and the ducts of Bartholin’s glands may all
be involved in the inflammation. The sebaceous glands
of the labia may be especially involved, producing a form
of sebaceous acne which has been called <i>follicular vulvitis</i>.
Inguinal adenitis may accompany vulvitis.</p>

<p>The appearance of the parts is that characteristic of inflammation
of the skin and mucous membrane in any
other part of the body. The mucous membrane becomes
red and swollen; the labia may become edematous; an
abundant purulent discharge covers the parts, and unless
cleanliness is practised the irritation from the discharge
spreads to the inner aspects of the thighs, the perineum,
and the anal region.</p>

<p>The patient suffers with local pain, which is increased
by walking and by the passage or contact of urine.</p>

<p>The usual cause of vulvitis is gonorrhea. The condition
is sometimes secondary to other diseases. It may
be caused by the irritation from the discharges of a
vesico-vaginal or recto-vaginal fistula, from a cancer of
the cervix or in some forms of endometritis. Girls and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
women who are unclean may be attacked by vulvitis as a
result of irritation from decomposed smegma, sweat,
urine, etc. The oxyuris, or thread-worm, may enter the
vulva from the rectum and cause, in unclean children,
sufficient irritation to produce inflammation. Vulvitis
from uncleanliness is most likely to occur in hot weather
after prolonged exercise. It not infrequently attacks
children, especially those of a strumous diathesis, whose
hygienic surroundings are poor. In such cases the suspicions
of the parents may demand a medico-legal examination;
and it is of importance to remember that vulvitis
of this kind is not rare, and is not due to violation
or contagion. Vulvitis in little girls may be also due to
gonorrhea, independently of violation. This is the cause
of epidemics of vulvitis and vaginitis in girls crowded in
houses, hospitals, or asylums. The disease is spread by
contamination from towels or bed-clothing.</p>

<p>The essential points of treatment to observe in the
acute stage of vulvitis are rest in the recumbent posture
and perfect cleanliness. The labia should be separated
and the parts frequently bathed and cleaned with warm
water. Various local washes or applications are of use.
A warm solution of boracic acid (ʒj to a pint of water),
the dilute solution of the subacetate of lead, or a solution
of bichloride of mercury (1:5000) may be used.</p>

<p>If the disease is of gonorrheal origin, the parts should
be painted once or twice a day with a 2 per cent. solution
of nitrate of silver, applied after the discharges have
been gently washed away.</p>

<p>As the disease subsides the inflammation may be found
to persist in the crypts of the vestibule, the urinary
meatus, and the ducts of Bartholin’s glands. It is very
important that all remains of the inflammation, especially
if it be of septic or gonorrheal origin, should be eradicated
before the woman is discharged from treatment.
The presence of any focus of inflammation, even though
latent, is a constant source of danger to the woman; for septic
organisms or material may be carried from the external
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
genitals to the higher parts of the genital tract, as the uterus
and Fallopian tubes, with the most disastrous results.</p>

<p>Sometimes a small drop of pus will be observed escaping
from one of the small glands or crypts of the vestibule,
about the urinary meatus, after the inflammation
has disappeared in other parts of the vulva. In this case
the gland should be punctured with a fine cautery-point
or a fine wooden probe or point saturated with pure carbolic
acid or other caustic.</p>

<p>If the disease persists in the external meatus or urethra,
it must be treated by the local applications appropriate
for urethritis.</p>

<p><b id="INFLAMMATION_OF_THE_VULVO_VAGINAL_GLANDS">Inflammation of the Vulvo-vaginal Glands.</b>&mdash;The
vulvo-vaginal glands are two in number. They are
about the size of a bean, and are situated deeply on the
inner aspect of the labia majora, where they may be
felt in thin women. The duct of the gland is about one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
inch in length, and opens immediately in front of the
hymen, about the middle of the side of the ostium
vaginæ. In cases of vulvitis the duct of the gland
usually becomes inflamed, and the inflammation may
extend to the gland, producing abscess of the vulvo-vaginal
gland.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the duct and the gland may also occur
independently of vulvitis, from direct septic or gonorrheal
infection.</p>

<p>Suppuration of the duct may be demonstrated by pressing
over the course of the duct, when a drop of pus will
escape from the opening. In such cases the orifice of
the duct is usually surrounded by a red areola, resembling
a flea-bite, which has been called the gonorrheal macula
(<a href="#fig_16">Fig. 16</a>). This macula persists long after all other traces
of inflammation about the vulva and vagina have disappeared,
and after all frank suppuration in the duct has
subsided. Its presence indicates at least the probability
of previous gonorrheal infection.</p>

<p>When the duct of the gland alone is the seat of inflammation,
it should be laid open with fine scissors or knife,
and the tract thoroughly cauterized with the nitrate-of-silver
stick, pure carbolic acid, or a solution of chloride
of zinc (2 per cent.).</p>

<p><b id="SUPPURATION_OF_THE_VULVO_VAGINAL_GLAND">Suppuration of the vulvo-vaginal gland</b> is accompanied
by marked swelling and peripheral edema. The
swelling may extend to the anus, and is of characteristic
shape (<a href="#fig_17">Fig. 17</a>). The pain is always severe. Fluctuation
is first apparent on the inner surface of the labium
majus. If the condition is not treated, one or more
fistulous openings appear below the orifice of the duct,
and the pus is discharged. The condition then becomes
chronic. The fistulous openings persist. Acute inflammation
disappears from the gland, leaving it in a condition
of hypertrophic induration. A thin, milky or
greenish, purulent fluid may be pressed out of the duct
or the fistulous openings. Infection from this discharge
may be communicated to man, or may ascend the genital
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
tract, producing inflammation of the endometrium or of
the Fallopian tubes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_17" src="images/fig_17.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>&mdash;Abscess of right vulvo-vaginal gland.</p></div>

<p>In abscess of the vulvo-vaginal gland a free incision
should immediately be made into the labium at the junction
of the skin and the mucous membrane. The interior
should be wiped out with pure carbolic acid and the cavity
packed with gauze. If the disease is first seen in the
chronic stage, after the abscess has evacuated itself, the
only method of cure is to excise, with curved scissors,
the whole of the indurated gland, the duct, and the fistulous
tracts. The wound may be left open and packed,
or it may be closed immediately with buried catgut
sutures.</p>

<p><b id="CYSTS_OF_THE_VULVO_VAGINAL_GLANDS">Cysts of the Vulvo-vaginal Glands.</b>&mdash;Cysts may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
occur in the duct of the vulvo-vaginal gland or in the
gland itself. Cysts of the duct are small&mdash;about the size
of a chestnut. They are situated superficially, lying
immediately under the mucous membrane of the vagina
at the base of the labium minus.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_18" src="images/fig_18.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;Cyst of the right vulvo-vaginal gland (Hirst).</p></div>

<p>Cysts of the gland may be unilocular if formed at the
expense of a single lobule of the gland, or multilocular
if several lobules enter into their formation. These cysts
may attain the size of the fetal head (<a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>).</p>

<p>Cysts of the gland or of the duct are formed by retention
of the cyst-contents. The retention is due to occlusion
of the duct, usually the result of inflammation. In
some cases the duct remains pervious, and the retention
is due to the altered character of the secretion of the
gland, which becomes too viscous to pass, except under
unusual pressure, along the duct.</p>

<p>These cysts contain clear yellow or chocolate-colored
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
fluid. The diagnosis of cyst of the vulvo-vaginal gland
is usually not difficult. If we are in doubt in regard to
the fluid character of the tumor, this may be determined
with the exploring-needle.</p>

<p>Inguinal hernia, hydrocele of the canal of Nuck, cysts
of the round ligament, and sacculated cysts of old hernial
sacs may be mistaken for cysts of the vulvo-vaginal
glands. In such cases, however, the tumor lies more in
the upper and outer part of the labium majus, and extends
to, and may be connected with, the external inguinal
ring.</p>

<p>Cysts of the vulvo-vaginal glands should be treated by
free incision and packing, or by extirpation. If the sac
is emptied by the aspirator or by a small incision, it will
refill. The best method is to extirpate the cyst. In case
there has been no inflammatory action binding the cyst
to surrounding structures, extirpation without rupture is
easy. If rupture occurs, the cyst-wall may be dissected
off with the knife or removed with the curved scissors.
The wound may be immediately closed with deep and
superficial sutures.</p>

<p><b id="PRURITUS_VULVÆ">Pruritus Vulvæ.</b>&mdash;Pruritus vulvæ, or itching of the
vulva, may be due to a great variety of causes. Eruptions
of the vulva, such as eczema, cause itching. Irritation
from the discharge of vaginitis, metritis, cancer
of the cervix or body of the uterus, the presence in children
of the thread-worm, the irritation from diabetic
urine, or trophic lesions of the nerves due to diabetes,
may result in pruritus. Some of the pathological conditions
of the uterus, tubes, and ovaries may produce
reflex irritation of the nerves of the vulva, and cause
itching, in a manner similar to that in which vesical calculus
causes itching of the glans penis.</p>

<p>The congestion of the external genitals that accompanies
pregnancy may also produce pruritus.</p>

<p>There are some cases of pruritus vulvæ, however, in
which no physical cause for the intolerable itching can
be discovered, and in which minute examination of the
affected portions of skin or mucous membrane demonstrates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
no pathological change. Such cases are called
idiopathic.</p>

<p>The itching may be so severe that the woman cannot
refrain from scratching and rubbing the parts on all occasions.
She becomes debarred from the society of her
friends, and seeks relief in anodynes and hypnotics. The
continual scratching increases the irritation of the vulva,
and an eczematous eruption may result, which produces
an irritating discharge that spreads the irritation to other
parts of the body with which it may come in contact.</p>

<p>The itching of pruritus may extend into the vagina, to
the skin of the abdomen, to the inner aspect of the thighs,
and to the anus.</p>

<p>In the treatment of pruritus it is first of importance to
discover, if possible, the cause of the itching. Any
vaginal or uterine discharge should be investigated.
Discharge from the uterus can be eliminated as a cause
by placing against the external os a pledget of cotton,
frequently renewed, to absorb the discharge before it
reaches the vulva, or the parts may be kept clean by
frequent douches. In children the stools should be examined
for the thread-worm. The urine should always
be examined. Diabetes is a frequent cause of pruritus
vulvæ in old women. Any pathological condition of the
uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries should be treated
before we can eliminate this as a possible cause of pruritus.</p>

<p>In the cases of so-called idiopathic pruritus in which
no local lesion can be discovered attention should be
directed to the general nutrition of the patient. As in
pruritus ani, the gouty diathesis may cause the disease.
Alcoholic drinks, rich food, fish and shell-fish, may assist
in its production.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;A great variety of local applications have
been used for the relief of pruritus. In case of diabetes
the urine should, as much as possible, be kept from contact
with the parts, which should be thoroughly dried
after urinating, and dusted with a powder consisting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
of equal parts of subnitrate of bismuth and prepared
chalk.</p>

<p>The following local applications are useful in pruritus:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Bichloride of mercury,</td>
    <td>gr. ½;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Emulsion of bitter almonds,</td>
    <td>℥j,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="4">applied twice a day.</td>
  </tr>

<p>A powder of 1 grain of morphine to 2 grains of prepared
chalk, applied twice a day.</p>

<table class="list">

    <td>Tinct. opii,</td>
    <td />

    <td />
    <td>Acid, carbolic.,</td>
    <td />
    <td>ʒj,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="4">applied once or twice in the twenty-four hours.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>An ethereal solution of iodoform sprayed into the folds
of the vulva with an atomizer.</p>

<p>Cauterization with pure carbolic acid.</p>

<p>In pruritus of gouty origin an ointment, composed of
15 grains of calomel to 1 dram of cerate, will often relieve
or cure the local condition. A small quantity should be
rubbed over the itching area at bed-time. Often one or
two applications give immediate relief. If the condition
does not quickly improve it is useless to continue this
treatment. The danger of salivation from its prolonged
use should be remembered.</p>

<p>In cases which have resisted all local applications the
affected areas of mucous membrane have been excised.
Even this method, however, does not promise certain
cure. It should be tried, however, when the pruritus is
localized and has resisted the milder forms of treatment.</p>

<p><b id="KRAUROSIS_VULVÆ">Kraurosis Vulvæ.</b>&mdash;Kraurosis vulvæ is a very rare
disease, of chronic inflammatory nature, affecting the
vulva. The disease is characterized by cutaneous
atrophy, with very marked shrinking and contraction of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
the vaginal orifice. The lesions may be unilateral or
circumscribed, but usually the tissues of the labia majora,
the nymphæ, and the area surrounding the clitoris and
urinary meatus are more or less involved. The cause of
the disease has not as yet been determined. It has been
observed at every age after puberty, in the nulliparæ as
well as the multiparæ, and in the parturient woman. It
must be differentiated from pruritus and the atrophic
changes which take place after the physiological and
induced menopause.</p>

<p>The first symptoms noticed by the patient are usually
those of pruritus&mdash;an intense itching and burning about
the vulva. In some cases the affected tissue early
becomes excessively hyperplastic. The mucous membrane
and the skin of the vulva are often discolored,
small red spots appearing, which are sensitive to touch.
Later a peculiar shrinking of the superficial tissue takes
place, and the diseased surfaces become dry and whitened.
The nymphæ gradually disappear, fusing with
the labia majora; and the mucous membrane and skin
become shiny and drawn smoothly over the shrunken
clitoris. Cracks or fissures appear on the dry surfaces.
A sensation of drawing and shrinking of the vulva is
now usually experienced. The vaginal orifice gradually
narrows and contracts, until frequently the little finger
can scarcely be introduced. When this last condition of
atrophy is reached, the pathological process is arrested,
the subjective sensations of shrinking pass away, and the
symptoms resembling pruritus are no longer experienced.
The shrunken and contracted vaginal orifice, however,
persists and is never spontaneously restored.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Palliative treatment by local applications
may be tried, or a cure may be attempted by operation.
The palliative treatment is simply directed toward the
relief of the subjective symptoms, which at times are
exceedingly painful. Pure carbolic acid or a solution of
cocaine applied locally, or pure nitrate of silver applications
frequently repeated, afford temporary relief. Cloths
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
wrung out of hot water and placed over the vulva also
lessen the suffering. A solution of the neutral acetate
of lead in glycerin, on cotton placed between the labia,
is recommended. Forced dilatation of the vaginal orifice
under ether has been practised with good result. The
most satisfactory treatment is complete excision of the
diseased tissue. Unless all affected tissue is removed,
the disease may return.</p>

<p><b id="VARICOSE_TUMORS_OF_THE_VULVA">Varicose Tumors of the Vulva.</b>&mdash;Varicose tumors
of the vulva are usually the result of pregnancy. They
may, however, accompany any form of pelvic or abdominal
tumor, the pressure of which interferes with the venous
circulation of the pelvis. The varicose condition
usually affects the labia majora. It varies from a mere
increase in size of the veins of the vulva to a varicose
tumor the size of the fetal head. The condition, being
secondary, usually disappears with the removal of the
exciting cause. The labia may be supported with a
compress and a bandage.</p>

<p><b id="HEMATOMA_OF_THE_VULVA">Hematoma of the Vulva.</b>&mdash;Hematoma of the vulva
is due to the subcutaneous rupture of a vein. Blows,
kicks, or falls cause this condition. It is usually produced
by rupture of a varicose vein during pregnancy or
labor.</p>

<p>The affected labium is purple in color and may reach
the size of a fetal head. When the hematoma is small
the vagina should be kept as clean and aseptic as possible,
and a light compress should be applied. Absorption
usually takes place. If the collection of blood is large
or if it has become infected, a free incision should be
made into the labium, the clots should be turned out, and
the cavity thoroughly washed and packed with gauze.</p>

<p><b id="PAPILLOMA">Papilloma.</b>&mdash;Papillomata or warts of the vulva are not
uncommon. They may occur singly, scattered over the
vulva and the neighboring skin, and extending up the vagina
as far as the cervix uteri, or they may occur in large
cauliflower-like masses. They are pink or purplish in
color. They often exude a bloody, offensive discharge,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
which is capable of exciting a similar condition by contact.
Papilloma is usually the result of gonorrhea or
syphilis. It may, however, be caused by irritation from
filth or by the leucorrhea of pregnancy.</p>

<p>The treatment of papilloma is by excision. The small
warts should be picked up with forceps and clipped off
with curved scissors. Every one should be removed or
the condition may recur. In the case of large papillomatous
tumors the wound of excision should be closed
with continuous sutures. Pregnancy is no contraindication
to excision of papillomata.</p>

<p>The vulva may be the seat of epithelioma, lupus, sarcoma,
fibroma, fibromyoma, myxoma, lipoma, or enchondroma.
These tumors present the same characteristics
and demand the same surgical treatment as in other parts
of the body.</p>

<p>Small cysts have been found in the labia majora and
minora, the vestibule, the hymen, and the clitoris.</p>

<p><b id="ELEPHANTIASIS">Elephantiasis.</b>&mdash;True elephantiasis of the vulva (elephantiasis
Arabum), due to the presence of the Filaria
sanguinis hominis, is a rare disease in this climate.
The disease occurs especially in Barbadoes. It may
affect the labia and the clitoris. The hypertrophied
labia may attain the size of the adult head.</p>

<p>The treatment of this condition is excision of the
affected structures.</p>

<p>There is a syphilitic form of hypertrophy or elephantiasis
of the vulva which is not uncommon in this
country. The labia minora and majora may be transformed
into enormous flap-like folds. Though at first
free from ulceration, this may subsequently result from
chafing. Warty growths may cover the hypertrophied
labia, the perineum, and the buttocks. The disease
usually affects both labia, though it may be confined
to one.</p>

<p>This manifestation of syphilis does not yield readily to
constitutional or local medicinal treatment. Many cases
prove to be incurable by medicine. Antisyphilitic treatment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
should always be tried at first, and if this fails, the
hypertrophied structures should be excised with the knife.</p>

<p>If, in such cases, there is any doubt in regard to diagnosis
between syphilis and cancer, a small portion of
tissue should be excised and submitted to microscopic
examination.</p>

<p><b id="ADHESIONS_OF_THE_CLITORIS">Adhesions of the Clitoris.</b>&mdash;Adhesions between the
glans of the clitoris and the prepuce or hood which
covers it are exceedingly common. Usually no trouble
whatever is caused by these adhesions, unless an accumulation
of smegma takes place, or irritation is produced
by the presence of a concretion.</p>

<p>In case of any irritation about the genitals, the prepuce
and clitoris should always be carefully examined. In
fact, a careful examination of the clitoris should form a
routine part of all examinations of the external genitals.</p>

<p>When trouble arises from the presence of adhesions,
the prepuce should be drawn back and the adhesions
freed with a blunt probe. A 20 per cent. solution of
cocaine should be applied to the clitoris for ten minutes
previous to the operation. The whole corona and the
sulcus back of the corona should be exposed. The raw
surface should be covered with vaseline, and the patient
should abstain from walking as long as pain is caused by
it. The prepuce should be drawn back and vaseline
applied every day for two weeks, to prevent the formation
of adhesions.

<h3 id="DISEASES_OF_THE_VAGINA">DISEASES OF THE VAGINA.</h3>

<p><b id="INFLAMMATION_OF_THE_VAGINA">Inflammation of the Vagina.</b>&mdash;Acute inflammation
of the vagina is not a very common affection. Primary
inflammation confined to the vagina alone is unusual.
The disease in most cases is secondary to vulvitis, urethritis,
or endo-cervicitis. The causes of vulvitis (which
have already been considered) are also the causes of
vaginitis. It is of importance to remember that the disease
may occur in children as a result of the same factors
which produce vulvitis.</p>

<p>The exanthemata, as measles and scarlet fever, may
cause vaginitis as part of the general involvement of the
skin and mucous membrane which occurs in these diseases.
The most usual cause is gonorrhea.</p>

<p>Several varieties of acute vaginitis may be recognized&mdash;the
simple, the granular, the senile, and the emphysematous.
It is unusual to find the entire surface of the
vagina involved. The disease is confined to areas or
patches separated by healthy tissue.</p>

<p>In <i>simple vaginitis</i> the inflamed membrane remains
smooth.</p>

<p>In <i>granular vaginitis</i>, which is the variety usually seen,
the papillæ are infiltrated with small cells, and are much
enlarged, so that the inflamed surface has a granular
appearance.</p>

<p><i>Senile vaginitis</i> is due to infection of portions of the
vaginal mucous membrane that have lost their epithelium
as a result of the atrophic changes of old age. This disease
occurs in patches of various size, sometimes presenting
the character of ecchymosis; in other cases the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
patches have altogether lost the epithelium, and permanent
adhesions may take place between areas which are
brought in contact. This form of vaginitis has also been
called adhesive vaginitis. It is said that a similar condition
may occur in children.</p>

<p>The <i>emphysematous</i> form of vaginitis occurs in pregnancy.
The vaginal walls are swollen and crepitating.
The gas is contained in the meshes of the connective
tissue.</p>

<p>Acute vaginitis is accompanied by dull pain and a
sense of fulness in the pelvis. The discomfort is increased
by standing, walking, defecation, and urination.
There is a free discharge of serum or pus, which may be
tinged with blood. The character of the discharge
depends upon the variety and the period of the disease.
Inspection, which can best be made through the Sims
speculum, with the woman in the Sims or knee-chest
position, shows the characteristic lesions of inflammation
of the mucous membrane.</p>

<p>Acute vaginitis, if neglected, may pass into the chronic
form. It usually lingers in the upper part of the vagina,
in the fornices, especially in vaginitis of gonorrheal
origin. By careful inspection we find here one or more
granular patches of inflammation, which cause a vaginal
discharge from which man may be infected, and from
which infection of the upper portion of the genital tract,
the uterus, and the Fallopian tubes may be derived.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Vaginitis, especially of the gonorrheal
form, should be treated vigorously, and treatment should
be continued until all traces of inflammation have disappeared.
Inflammation of any part of the lower portion
of the genital tract may have the most disastrous consequences
if it extends to the uterus and the Fallopian
tubes.</p>

<p>The woman should be kept as quiet as possible. The
bowels should be moved freely with saline purgatives.
She should take, three times in twenty-four hours, lying
upon her back, a vaginal douche of one gallon of a boracic-acid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
solution (ʒj to the pint). The temperature of
the solution should be about 110° F.</p>

<p>If the disease be of gonorrheal origin, a warm bichloride
solution (1:5000) should be used in the same way.</p>

<p>After the acute symptoms have subsided local applications
should be made, in addition to the douches. The
woman should be placed in the knee-chest position, and
the vagina should be thoroughly exposed with the Sims
speculum. If necessary, the vaginal surface should be
gently cleaned with warm water and cotton. A 4 per
cent. solution of cocaine may be applied to the vagina if
there is much pain. Then the entire vaginal surface
should be painted with a solution of bichloride of mercury
(1:1000). These applications should be made
daily until the disease is cured. The vaginal douches
should be continued at the same time.</p>

<p>In the chronic form of the disease and in senile vaginitis
the local patches of inflammation should be painted
once a day with a solution of nitrate of silver, 5 to 10
per cent., or stronger if the condition does not yield.
The senile form of vaginitis, being dependent upon a
general condition, is often impossible to cure. We can
sometimes relieve the discomfort by applying boracic-acid
ointment (ʒj to ℥j) to the vagina. The application
of pure carbolic acid to the inflamed patches sometimes
does good.</p>

<p>Urethritis usually accompanies a gonorrheal vaginitis,
and demands coincident treatment.</p>

<p><b id="TUMORS_OF_THE_VAGINA">Tumors of the Vagina.</b>&mdash;<i>Vaginal Cysts.</i>&mdash;Well-defined
cysts are sometimes found in the vaginal walls.
They occur at all ages from childhood to old age.</p>

<p>Vaginal cysts are usually single. They vary in size
from that of a pea to that of a fetal head. The vaginal
mucous membrane covers the free surface of the cyst,
and may either be movable over it or may be much attenuated
and closely incorporated with the cyst-wall.
Vaginal cysts may be sessile or more or less pedunculated.
The internal surface of the cyst is usually covered with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
cylindrical epithelium, which is sometimes ciliated. The
contents vary in consistency and color. They are often
viscid, transparent, and of a pale yellow tint. They may
contain pus or altered blood.</p>

<p>The origin of vaginal cysts has been much disputed.
It is probable that they arise from the remains of the
Wolffian canal&mdash;the canal of Gärtner. In the embryo
the transverse or longitudinal tubule of the parovarium
extends to the side of the uterus and thence down the
side of the vagina to the urethral orifice. It persists in
this condition in some of the lower animals&mdash;the sow and
the cow&mdash;and may also persist as a closed tube in woman.
In such cases it may become distended and form the
vaginal cyst.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> of vaginal cyst is removal. If the tumor
be situated near the vulva, it may be extirpated by
careful dissection. If this operation be deemed impracticable,
partial excision of the cyst should be practised.
The tumor should be seized with a tenaculum, opened by
the scissors, and part of the wall, with the overlying
mucous membrane, should be excised. The interior of
the cyst should then be packed with gauze.</p>

<p><i>Fibroid Tumors of the Vagina.</i>&mdash;Fibroid tumors sometimes
occur in the vagina. They are usually found in
the upper part of the anterior wall. They are sometimes
adherent to the urethra. They are usually of small size,
but may attain a diameter of six inches. The treatment
of such tumors is removal.</p>

<p>Cancer and sarcoma may attack the vagina, though
these diseases as primary conditions are very rare. When
possible, complete removal should be done.</p>

<p><b id="ATRESIA_OF_THE_VAGINA">Atresia of the Vagina.</b>&mdash;Severe puerperal infection
or mechanical injury, followed by extensive destruction
of the tissues of the vagina, may result in a cicatricial
narrowing or complete closure or atresia of the vaginal
canal.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i> of this condition are due to retention
of the uterine discharges. There is no discharge of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
menstrual blood from the vagina. Attacks of pain occur
periodically at the menstrual periods. A cystic tumor,
which may be felt by rectal examination, is present.
The tumor consists of the distended portion of the
vaginal canal (hematocolpos), and sometimes of the distended
cervical canal and body of the uterus. The contents
of the hematocolpos are usually sterile, although
they may become purulent (pyocolpos).</p>

<p>The <i>diagnosis</i> is readily made by vaginal and rectal
examination.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i> consists in incision and excision of the
vaginal septum and the suture of the vaginal mucous
membrane above to that below the obstruction. In very
severe cases it is difficult to maintain the patulous condition
of the vaginal canal on account of subsequent cicatricial
contraction. In such cases the repeated passage
of vaginal bougies or the transplantation of mucous membrane
has been resorted to.</p>

<p><b id="VAGINISMUS">Vaginismus.</b>&mdash;The term “vaginismus” has been applied
to a condition characterized by a spasmodic contraction
of the muscles which close the vaginal orifice. The
muscular spasm occurs reflexly when penetration of the
vagina is attempted, as at coitus or a digital examination.
The condition is due to dread of pain, and is
usually the result of some painful local lesion, such as
a urethral caruncle, fissures or sores of the vulva or
anus, etc.; or it may be due to some painful condition of
the tubes and ovaries. Similar contraction is observed
in the sphincters of the anus when there is present a
painful anal lesion.</p>

<p>Vaginismus has been said to occur in neurotic and hysteric
women in whom there was no discoverable local
lesion.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i> consists in the removal of any local cause
of pain or irritation.</p>

<p>If the reflex spasm of the muscles persists when coitus
is attempted, notwithstanding the removal or the absence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
of any discoverable local cause, operative measures have
been advised.</p>

<p>Under anesthesia the vaginal entrance has been
stretched by means of large dilators or the fingers, or
the fibers of the sphincter vaginæ have been cut on each
side of the fourchette and a glass or vulcanite tube of
suitable size has then been placed in the vagina and
retained for two or three weeks by a perineal pad and <span class="sans">T</span>-bandage.</p>

<p>Vaginismus is a very rare condition. Operative treatment,
except that which may be required for the removal
of some local cause of irritation, is rarely, if ever, necessary.</p>

<p><b id="COCCYGODYNIA">Coccygodynia.</b>&mdash;Coccygodynia is a rare affection characterized
by pain in the coccyx and surrounding structures.
The pain is caused by pressure, as in sitting, or
by any movement involving the muscles attached to the
coccyx. The disease is usually caused by traumatism,
and in most cases is due to injuries to the coccyx in
labor, as a result of which the bone is fractured or dislocated,
and becomes fixed in an abnormal position. Sometimes
osteitis or necrosis develops. In the unusual cases,
in which no structural changes are detected, the condition
may be due to rheumatism. Coccygodynia is very rarely
found in men.</p>

<p>The <i>diagnosis</i> may be made by introducing the index
finger in the rectum and palpating the anterior and lateral
surfaces of the coccyx, and by moving the bone
between the finger in the rectum and the thumb placed
in the crease of the nates. The mobility, deformity, and
tenderness may be readily determined. If a local lesion
is found, and the symptoms have not yielded within a
reasonable time to expectant treatment, removal of the
coccyx by operation is indicated. The coccyx is exposed
by a median incision, the bone is separated from its muscular
and tendinous attachments, and is removed at the
sacrococcygeal articulation with scalpel or scissors. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
the articulation is ankylosed, it may be necessary to use
the chain-saw. The wound is drained with a few strands
of silkworm-gut and closed with interrupted sutures.</p>

<p>Operation should not be advised hastily. The painful
symptoms are not always relieved by it. Operation should
not be performed unless bony deformity or other distinct
lesion is found.

<h3 id="ANATOMY_AND_MECHANISM_OF_THE_PERINEUM">ANATOMY AND MECHANISM OF THE PERINEUM.</h3>

<p>An accurate knowledge of the anatomy and mechanism
of the female perineum is essential to an understanding
of the nature and treatment of injuries to this structure.
The anatomical structures lying between the anus behind
and the symphysis pubis in front are those that most
directly interest the gynecologist. Proceeding from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
below upward, we find the following structures lying in
superimposed planes: the skin, the superficial fascia, the
deep layer of the superficial fascia, the transversus perinæi
and the sphincter vaginæ muscles, the anterior layer of
the triangular ligament, the posterior layer of the triangular
ligament, the levator ani muscle (<a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_18a" src="images/fig_18a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18,</span> <i>A.</i>&mdash;Superficial structures of the female perineum (Weisse).</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Dissection of female perineum: on the left side the perineal muscles
are exposed by the reflection of the perineal fascia; on the right side the
muscles and the superficial layer of the triangular ligament have been removed,
thereby exposing the deep layer of the ligament. <i>S. V.</i>, Sphincter vaginæ muscle.</p></div>

<p>The vagina passes through these structures. They
surround and support the ostium vaginæ as the fascia
and muscles surround and support the opening of the
rectum or the anus. The muscles and fasciæ are
attached in the median line between the anus and the
vagina, and therefore this part of the body, which is
called the perineum, is supported or maintained in its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
proper position by these various structures. The transversus
perinæi arises from the ramus of the ischium and
is inserted in the perineum. The bulbo-cavernosus, or
sphincter vaginæ, arises in the perineum and is inserted
in and about the clitoris. The inner fibers of the levator
ani arise from the symphysis pubis and are inserted in
the perineum and the lower part of the vagina (<a href="#fig_20">Fig. 20</a>).
When these muscles contract, their action, therefore, is
to draw the perineum upward and forward. At the same
time the anus is drawn upward and forward, and so also
is the posterior margin of the ostium vaginæ and the
lower portion of the posterior vaginal wall.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_20" src="images/fig_20.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>&mdash;Dissection of female perineum, showing the deeper structures after
removal of the levator and sphincter ani muscles.</p></div>

<p>The vagina has no circular sphincter like the anus, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
the vaginal month is kept closed by the action of the
transversus perinæi, sphincter vaginæ, and levator ani
muscles, which draw the perineum forward, and thus
keep the posterior vaginal wall in apposition with the
anterior wall.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>&mdash;Muscular floor of the pelvis seen from above.</p></div>

<p>This sling of muscles and fascia, which surrounds and
supports the opening of the vagina, may readily be felt in
the nulliparous woman by introducing the finger in the
vagina and pressing backward and outward toward the
ischio-rectal fossa. We then feel plainly, immediately
within the ostium vaginæ, a firm resisting band of tissue,
apparently about half an inch broad, embracing the posterior
portion of the lower vagina. This band is formed
by the inner edges of the various muscles and planes of
fascia that have been described.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;Sagittal section showing relations of the several layers of fascia within

<p>The vagina extends, as a transverse slit in the pelvic
floor, upward and backward, approximately in the direction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
of a line drawn from the ostium vaginæ to the
fifth sacral vertebra. It is approximately parallel with
the conjugate of the brim, so that when the woman is
erect the long axis of the vagina is inclined at an angle
of 60° to the horizon. The vagina is not a vertical open
tube: it is a slit in the pelvic floor, in health always
closed by the accurate apposition of the anterior and posterior
walls (<a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>). The anterior vaginal wall is about
2½ inches long in a vertical mesial line. The posterior
vaginal wall is about 3½ inches long. The vaginal walls
are triangular in shape, being broader above than below.
The shape of the normal vagina at the pelvic outlet is
shown by <a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23</a>. The section here shows the vaginal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
slit of the shape of the letter <span class="sans">H</span>. The portions of the
slit extending backward and somewhat outward are
called the vaginal sulci or furrows. They are directions
of diminished resistance in which tears are liable to
occur.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3 id="INJURIES_TO_THE_PERINEUM">INJURIES TO THE PERINEUM.</h3>

<p>The injuries to the perineum that may result from
childbirth are classified according to the position or the
direction and extent of the laceration. They are as
follows: slight median tear; median tear involving the
sphincter ani; tear in one or both of the vaginal sulci;
subcutaneous laceration of the muscles and fascia.</p>

<p>All these injuries demand operative treatment. The
operation for the repair of injuries to the perineum is
called perineorrhaphy. It is called immediate or primary,
intermediate, and secondary perineorrhaphy, according
to the time after the receipt of the injury at
which the operation is performed. The primary operation
is done during the first twenty-four hours. The primary
operation should always be performed. A careful inspection
of the perineum and the posterior vaginal wall should
always be made after labor, and any laceration should
be repaired within twenty-four hours. The advantages
of the primary operation are many. The parts are
usually so numb that it is not necessary to administer an
anesthetic. No denudation is necessary, and therefore
no tissue need be sacrificed. The woman is spared the
pain and discomfort of granulation and cicatrization.</p>

<p>The bad results that follow neglect of the primary
operation are very numerous, and will be studied hereafter.
The injured muscles retract, and, being functionally
useless, undergo atrophy, and when finally repaired
never possess their former strength. Involution in the
vagina and the uterus may be arrested, and all the disasters
incident to subinvolution may appear. Vaginal
and uterine prolapse occur; the natural supports of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
vagina and uterus become stretched, and, though afterward
the perineum may be restored, yet it may be found
impossible to retain the uterus in its proper position. It
is always good surgery to repair an injury as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>When practicable, a certain amount of preparation of
the patient should be made before the operation of perineorrhaphy.
This is most easily effected before the
intermediate and secondary operations. The vagina
and the vulva should be sterilized, and the intestinal
tract should be emptied. Thorough evacuation of the
bowels is most important when the sphincter ani has
been injured, because it is desirable, after operation
for this lesion, that the bowels should not be moved for
five or six days. A saline purgative should be administered
on an empty stomach about five hours before the
operation, and a rectal injection of soap and water
should be administered about one hour before the operation.
Whatever purgative be employed, it should be
administered at such a time that its action shall have
ceased by the time of the operation. If this precaution
is not observed, there may be a discharge of feces
that will infect the wound and interfere with the manipulations.</p>

<p>For operation upon the perineum the woman should
be placed in the dorso-sacral position (<a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>, page 23).</p>

<p>The intermediate operation is performed during the
granulation period&mdash;ten days or two weeks after labor.
At this time the raw surfaces are covered with granulation-tissue
and bathed with pus. The edges of the wound
and the surrounding tissue may be hard and swollen
from infiltration with inflammatory products. In the intermediate
operation it is necessary to administer an anesthetic
or to anesthetize the parts locally with a 10 per
cent. solution of cocaine.</p>

<p>All cicatricial tissue, granulation-tissue, and rough
edges should be scraped away with the knife, the scissors,
or the curet. The raw surfaces should be thoroughly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
washed with a 50 per cent. solution of peroxide
of hydrogen and a 1:1000 solution of bichloride of mercury.
The sutures should then be introduced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Tenacula for plastic operations.</p></div>

<p>The secondary operation is performed at any time after
cicatrization has occurred&mdash;often many years after the
receipt of the injury. This operation is at present one
of the commonest in gynecology, because the injury is
not detected, is neglected, or is improperly repaired after
labor. In the secondary operation an anesthetic is necessary.
The mucous membrane must be removed or denuded
on the posterior wall and about the mouth of the
vagina, in order that the lacerated structures may be
brought again in apposition. The denudation is best
made by means of scissors curved on the flat (Figs. 24
and 25).</p>

<p>The strip of mucous membrane to be removed is picked
up with a tenaculum (<a href="#fig_26">Fig. 26</a>) or with tissue forceps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
(<a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a>); the scissors are placed with the blades parallel
to the surface to be denuded, and the strip is cut away
evenly, in one piece if possible. A similar contiguous
strip is removed, and so on until the necessary surface is
bare. Sponges in holders (<a href="#fig_28">Fig. 28</a>) or continuous irrigation
may be used to remove blood.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>&mdash;Sponge-holder.</p></div>

<p>For all operations on the perineum round-pointed
needles curved at the tip should be used (<a href="#fig_29">Fig. 29</a>). The
tissues are always sufficiently soft for the
passage of such a needle. A needle with
a cutting edge is unnecessary and may
increase the bleeding.</p>

<p>The needle may be held in any kind
of needle-holder preferred. The Emmet
needle-holder (<a href="#fig_30">Fig. 30</a>) is very convenient.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>&mdash;Emmet’s needle-holder.</p></div>

<p>The point of the needle should be
guided and held by the tenaculum. The
tenaculum must always be held in a
plane parallel with the plane of the
needle-holder; otherwise the needle-point may escape
from the embrace of the tenaculum.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>Silver wire and silkworm gut are the best sutures in
the operation of perineorrhaphy.</p>

<p>The suture is conveniently attached to the needle by
means of a silk carrier (<a href="#fig_31">Fig. 31</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img id="fig_32" src="images/fig_32.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>&mdash;Shot-compressor.</p></div>

<p>The sutures may be fastened by passing the ends
through a perforated shot which is slipped down to the
line of union and compressed by the shot-compressor
(<a href="#fig_32">Fig. 32</a>). All blood should be carefully removed from
the surfaces that are brought together. The sutures
should only be sufficiently tense to produce accurate apposition.
A light gauze drain should be introduced in
the vagina, and should be removed in forty-eight hours.
Afterward one vaginal douche of about a quart of warm
bichloride solution (1:2000) should be administered every
day. After the douche the labia should be separated and
the vagina carefully dried by cotton held in dressing-forceps.
Except in those cases in which the sphincter ani
is involved, the bowels may be moved on the second or
third day. The woman should stay in bed for two weeks,
at the end of which time the sutures should be removed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
She should avoid heavy lifting, long standing, and bicycle-
or horseback-riding for two months after the operation.
Constipation should always be avoided. Coitus
may be resumed six weeks after operation.</p>

<p>The special forms of operation will be discussed in the
consideration of the varieties of perineal injury.</p>

<p><b id="SLIGHT_MEDIAN_LACERATION_OF_THE_PERINEUM">Slight Median laceration of the Perineum.</b>&mdash;In
this injury the tear takes place through the fourchette.
Posteriorly it may extend
as far as the sphincter ani
muscle. Upward it may
extend for an inch up the
posterior vaginal wall. The
appearance of this tear is
shown in <a href="#fig_33">Fig. 33</a>. It will
be noted that, as this tear
takes place in the median
line, none of the muscles
that support the perineum
are involved, nor are the
planes of fascia injured.
The perineum is slightly
split, and the insertions and
origins of the muscles and
the fascia are slightly separated.
The supporting
structures of the perineum
and the pelvic floor are,
however, uninjured.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_33" src="images/fig_33.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;Recent slight median
laceration of the perineum: sutures
introduced.</p></div>

<p>If this tear is detected
after labor, it should be closed by the immediate operation.
A slight tear involving chiefly the cutaneous
aspect of the perineum should be closed by three or four
sutures introduced from the outside, as in <a href="#fig_33">Fig. 33</a>. The
needle should be introduced about a quarter of an inch
from the edge of the wound. It should not be passed
parallel with the plane of the lacerated surface, but
should be swept outward and then inward toward the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
angle at the bottom of the tear (<a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34</a>). It may either
emerge at the angle and be re-introduced, or it may be
passed directly through to the skin-margin on the opposite
side of the wound. If
the suture is passed in this
way, there will be perfect apposition
throughout the whole
surface of laceration. If the
sutures are improperly passed,
there may result only apposition
of the skin-edges.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_34" src="images/fig_34.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>&mdash;Diagram representing the correct and the incorrect method of passing
the suture for closure of slight perineal laceration.</p></div>

<p>If the laceration extends
up the posterior vaginal wall,
two sets of sutures must be
introduced&mdash;one on the vaginal
aspect of the tear, and
one on the skin aspect (<a href="#fig_35">Fig.
35</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

and cutaneous aspects.</p></div>

<p>The secondary operation
of perineorrhaphy is not indicated
in slight median
lacerations of the perineum
that may have been neglected
at the time of labor, as the
integrity of the pelvic floor
is practically unaffected by
them.</p>

<p><b id="MEDIAN_TEAR_INVOLVING_THE_SPHINCTER_ANI">Median Tear involving the Sphincter Ani.</b>&mdash;In this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
form of injury the laceration takes place in the median
line and extends backward through the sphincter ani
muscle, and perhaps upward for one or more inches
through the recto-vaginal septum. Permanent incontinence
of feces results.</p>

<p>Though this is a most extensive injury attended by
most unpleasant results, yet it will be seen that none of
the supporting structures (the fascia and the muscles) that
support the pelvic floor are injured by it.</p>

<p>The perineum is split in the middle, but the muscles
attached to it, being uninjured, are still able to draw the
two halves of the perineum forward, thus supporting the
posterior vaginal wall and keeping the vagina closed.
There is but very little tendency to separation of the two
parts of the split perineum by lateral traction, the only
muscle that acts at all in this direction being the feeble
transverse perineal muscle.</p>

<p>Therefore, though there is loss of power of the sphincter
ani muscle, yet in this injury the woman may not
suffer any of the consequences of loss of power in the
support of the pelvic floor, such as vaginal and uterine
prolapse.</p>

<p>After laceration of the perineum through the sphincter
ani the divided muscle retracts so that it embraces only
the posterior margin of the anus. If the injury be not
repaired immediately, retraction and atrophy progress, so
that in time the sphincter muscle, lying posterior to the
anal opening, may be but half an inch in length and of
very much less than its normal thickness. Cicatrization
takes place, and the parts present the appearance shown
in <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the atrophy and retraction of the
muscle, continence may be re-established by operation,
though many years may have elapsed since the receipt of
the injury.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the very obvious reasons for the performance
of the immediate operation for the relief of
this condition, it is yet very often neglected, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
gynecologist is called upon to repair the injury many
years after its occurrence.</p>

<p>The important part of the operation for this injury
consists in the repair of the muscle. In many operations
the recto-vaginal septum
is repaired and the cutaneous
portion of the perineum
is repaired, but the
operator fails to secure in
his sutures the sphincter
ani muscle, and consequently
the incontinence
is not cured (see <a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36</a>).
The mistake often made is
that the sutures that are
introduced to close the anterior
margin of the anus
are inserted too far forward
and too far out to catch
the ends of the sphincter
ani muscle, which has retracted
so that, in some
cases, it lies altogether behind
the anal opening.
Or, perhaps, only the outer fibers of the sphincter ani are
included in the suture, and partial incontinence results.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_36" src="images/fig_36.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>&mdash;Imperfect repair of the
sphincter ani. The muscle has not
been included by the sutures, and does
not surround the anal opening.</p></div>

<p>The position of the sphincter ani muscle is indicated
by the corrugated or wrinkled skin overlying it. The
ends of the muscles, being retracted, do not lie in the
plane of the laceration, but their position is marked by
a depression or dimple (<a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>).</p>

<p>The technique of the primary operation is included in
a consideration of that of the secondary operation, the
only difference being that in the latter operation denudation
is necessary.</p>

<p>The parts should first be denuded, so that they present
the same raw surface that was exposed in the original
laceration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>The lower end of the recto-vaginal septum that forms
the anterior margin of the anal opening is usually thin
and cicatricial where the mucous membranes of the
vagina and rectum unite. All this cicatricial tissue
should be cut away, and the mucous membrane of the
vagina may be drawn forward and separated by dissection
from the mucous membrane of the rectum, in order to
make a somewhat broader surface through which to pass
the sutures.</p>

<p>Special care should be directed to the denudation of
the ends of the sphincter muscle. The tissue lying at
the bottom of the depression that marks the end of the
sphincter should be picked up with forceps or a tenaculum
and carefully cut away. In removing tissue attached to
the mucous membrane
of the rectum the operator
should avoid cutting
the healthy portion of
this mucous membrane,
as bleeding from it is
often annoying.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_37" src="images/fig_37.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span>&mdash;An old laceration through
the sphincter ani. The sphincter muscle
lies behind the anal opening. Its position
is indicated by the wrinkled skin; its ends
are marked by the depressions on each
side of the anal opening.</p></div>

<p>The first suture should
be introduced at the margin
of the anal opening,
within the area of corrugated
skin that marks the
position of the muscle,
and behind the depression
that marks the end
of the muscle. The end
of the muscle may be
seized with a tenaculum
or with tissue-forceps and
drawn out to ensure that
the suture includes muscular
tissue. The needle
is then passed near the edge of the rectal mucous membrane
to the apex of the tear in the recto-vaginal septum.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
whence it emerges. It is re-introduced here, and passed
in a similar manner to emerge upon the opposite side,
behind the other end of the sphincter ani muscle (<a href="#fig_38">Fig.
38</a>). This suture is introduced very near the edge of
the wound, so that there may not be any inversion of
skin to prevent perfect apposition of the ends of the
muscle. In case there has been much retraction of
the sphincter ani muscle, the ends of the suture may
appear to lie behind the anal opening. The second
suture is introduced somewhat outside of the first&mdash;still,
however, within the area of the sphincter muscle&mdash;and
is passed in a similar manner to emerge in the apex of
the recto-vaginal tear anterior to the first suture. The
remaining sutures to close the perineum are passed as
already described in the operation for slight median tear
of the perineum. When the sutures are shotted, great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
care must be exercised in making perfect apposition of
the parts brought together by the first two sutures.
Sometimes such apposition is more easily secured by
shotting the anterior perineal sutures first. When the
operation is completed the first suture through the
sphincter is sometimes drawn upward, so that it disappears
in the anal opening. If the muscle has been properly
secured, it will be observed that the anal opening
is surrounded by the ring of wrinkled or corrugated skin
(<a href="#fig_39">Fig. 39</a>).</p>

<p>After this operation the bowels should not be moved
for five or six days. The intestinal contents should
then be rendered as soft as possible by the administration
of small repeated doses of some saline purgative,
as Rochelle salts ʒj, every hour for five or six hours.
If the woman feels that she may have difficulty in
having a passage, a rectal injection of a pint of soapsuds
and warm water should be
very carefully administered.
The nozzle of the
syringe should be well
greased and passed along
the posterior margin of
the anal opening. After
this the bowels should be
moved every forty-eight
hours. The sutures should

<p><b id="LACERATION_THROUGH_THE_SPHINCTER_ANI">Laceration through
the Sphincter Ani, involving
the Recto-vaginal
Septum.</b>&mdash;In case
the recto-vaginal septum
has been torn, it may be
necessary to repair the
tear before operating on
the perineum and the sphincter ani muscle. In some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
cases the laceration extends for three or more inches up
the septum (<a href="#fig_40">Fig. 40</a>).</p>

<p>The edges of the septal tear should be denuded, the
strip of tissue being cut away to the line of normal rectal
mucous membrane. Annoying bleeding may occur if the
mucous membrane of the rectum is injured. The denudation
may be extended on the vaginal aspect as far as is
necessary to obtain a sufficiently broad surface for approximation.</p>

<p>The tear in the septum should be closed by interrupted
sutures introduced from the vaginal aspect. The suture
is passed through the vaginal mucous membrane at about
an eighth of an inch from the edge of the wound, and
emerges in the edge of the rectal mucous membrane. It
should not pass through the rectal mucous membrane.</p>

<p>After the sutures in the recto-vaginal septum have been
shotted, the operator may proceed to repair the perineum
and the sphincter ani muscle (<a href="#fig_41">Figs. 41</a>, <a href="#fig_42">42</a>).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>There is a variety of perineal laceration (between the
first slight median laceration and the second complete
laceration through the sphincter ani) in which only the
outer fibers of the sphincter muscle are injured. In this
injury partial incontinence results. The woman may be
able to control feces when the movements are hard, but
loses control over liquid feces and flatus.</p>

<p>There is no loss of support of the pelvic floor, and the
indication for operation is the partial incontinence. The
operation is performed in a way similar to that already
described for complete laceration. The ends of the ruptured
fibers of the sphincter muscles are usually indicated
by a slight depression on the overlying skin or mucous
membrane.</p>

<p><b id="LACERATION_IN_ONE_OR_BOTH_VAGINAL_SULCI">Laceration in One or Both Vaginal Sulci.</b>&mdash;In
this form of injury the tear takes place not in the median
line, but in the direction of the vaginal sulci or furrows.
The left sulcus is usually the more deeply torn.</p>

<p>In this form of laceration the sphincter ani muscle
usually escapes injury; the tear is directed toward the
ischio-rectal fossa, and the rectum and anus are pushed to
one side. The structures of importance that are injured
are the fascia, the levator ani muscle, the sphincter muscle
of the vagina, and perhaps the transverse perineal
muscle. All the supporting structures of the perineum and
of the posterior vaginal wall are injured. If the laceration
be bilateral, complete loss of support of the perineum
and the posterior vaginal wall results, and if the condition
be untreated, all the disastrous consequences of loss
of support of the perineum occur&mdash;prolapse of the vagina,
of the uterus, and of the other pelvic organs.</p>

<p>It is unusual that this form of laceration is entirely
limited to one sulcus, though one is usually more involved
than the other. When the injury is limited to one side,
the perineum is still supported by the muscles and fascia
upon the other side, and the tendency to prolapse is not
so marked.</p>

<p>The nature of this injury may always be detected by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
examination after labor. The anterior vaginal wall
should be elevated by a retractor, and the posterior wall
should be carefully examined. An external tear of the
skin, generally in the median line, usually accompanies
laceration in the sulci; that is, the lacerations in the sulci
converge toward the fourchette.</p>

<p>The immediate operation should always be performed.
The torn sulci should be closed by sutures introduced on
the posterior vaginal wall (<a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a>), and the external tear
should be closed by sutures introduced as in the first form
of injury to the perineum, already described.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_43" src="images/fig_43.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span>&mdash;Sutures introduced for the closure of a recent perineal laceration in
the sulci.</p></div>

<p>If this form of perineal injury is not repaired by the
immediate operation, cicatrization takes place, and the
tears in the mucous membrane and in the skin become
healed. The fascia retracts, and the integrity of the supporting
planes of fascia is destroyed. The torn muscles,
the inner fibers of the levator ani and the sphincter vaginæ,
also retract and cease to furnish any support to the
perineum. In health these muscles embrace the lower
portion of the posterior vaginal wall like a sling, drawing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
it toward the symphysis pubis; after laceration in the
sulci the support of one or both of the arms of the sling
is destroyed.</p>

<p>The scars upon the mucous membrane and on the skin
in time become faint, with difficulty perceptible. By
elevating the anterior vaginal wall and closely inspecting
the posterior wall immediately within the ostium vaginæ
we may detect a fine irregular white line running in the
direction of the vaginal sulcus and dividing the normal
transverse ridges and furrows of the vaginal mucous
membrane. This is the only sign of former injury to
the vaginal mucous membrane. The injury to the underlying
structures&mdash;the supporting structures of the perineum,
the muscles and the fascia&mdash;is indicated by certain
characteristic and unmistakable signs. These signs are
best recognized after a careful study of the normal uninjured
perineum.</p>

<p>If an uninjured woman be placed in the lithotomy
position and the perineal region be carefully examined,
we observe the following points:</p>

<p>The anus is not prominent: it is drawn upward and
forward; the anal cleft is deep.</p>

<p>The perineum, or the surface between the anus and the
fourchette, is shallow; the distance from the anus to a
fixed point like the external meatus is relatively short:
this surface is more or less convex, showing muscular
tonicity.</p>

<p>If the labia are separated, it will be observed that the
anterior and posterior vaginal walls are in close apposition.
If the woman is made to strain or to bear down,
the vaginal walls appear to come into close contact; the
perineum is pushed directly downward, and becomes more
prominent under the increased intra-abdominal pressure,
but there is no tendency to eversion or rolling out of the
vaginal walls.</p>

<p>If the vulva is pricked with a needle, reflex muscular
action is immediately observed: the anus is drawn still
more upward and forward; the perineum is shortened;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the ostium vaginæ is closed more firmly by the drawing
forward of the posterior margin of the opening.
The test shows that the muscles supporting the perineum
are intact.</p>

<p>If the finger be introduced into the vagina and be
pressed backward and outward in either vaginal sulcus,
resisting structures are felt. There seems to be a band,
perhaps half an inch in breadth, immediately within the
ostium vaginæ, that holds forward the perineum and the
posterior vaginal wall and resists the pressure of the
finger.</p>

<p>Compare these characteristic features of the uninjured
perineum with what we observe in a woman in whom
there has been an untreated laceration of the perineum
in the vaginal sulci. Here the supporting structures of
the perineum have been destroyed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>&mdash;Diagram showing the sling of muscle and fascia supporting the
perineum and the posterior vaginal wall. In A the parts are intact; in B there
has been a laceration in the left vaginal sulcus; in C there has been a laceration
in both sulci; a suture has been introduced on the right side.</p></div>

<p>The anal cleft is shallow. The anus is prominent; the
surrounding structures present the appearance of relaxation.
The perineum is deep; the distance from the anus
to the external meatus is longer; the anus has really
dropped back. The skin-surface of the perineum is flat
and relaxed.</p>

<p>If the labia are separated, the anterior and posterior
vaginal walls will not be found in close apposition. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
ostium vaginæ is patulous and gaps open (<a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45</a>). If
the woman is made to bear down, the anterior and posterior
vaginal walls are not pushed together; they are
rolled out and protrude through the ostium vaginæ.</p>

<p>If the vulva is pricked with a needle, the woman draws
herself away; there is no reflex muscular action, closing
the vagina and drawing up the anus. The muscles of
the perineum have been destroyed.</p>

<p>If the finger is introduced in the vagina and pressed
backward and outward in
either vaginal sulcus, the
tissues are yielding and
soft; no supporting sling
of muscle and fascia is
felt.</p>

<p>These phenomena have
an unmistakable meaning,
and indicate clearly
the loss of the supporting
structures of the pelvic
floor.</p>

<p>The student should
acquire familiarity with
these tests by repeated
experiments on injured
and uninjured women.
It will easily be understood
that the same phenomena
characterize the
fourth form of injury to
the perineum&mdash;the subcutaneous
laceration.</p>

destroyed.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The treatment is directed to the restoration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of these supports. Each vaginal sulcus must be
denuded, so that the condition existing in the recent
injury (<a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a>) is reproduced, and the sutures must be
passed so that the retracted muscles and the fascia are
brought back to their normal attachments. The best
method of operating for this condition has been devised
by Emmet.</p>

<p><i>Emmet’s Operation</i> (Figs. 45-55).&mdash;When the labia
have been separated, it will be observed that there is a
bulging or prominence of the lower portion of the posterior
vaginal wall, which is called a rectocele. The most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
prominent point or the apex of the rectocele should be
held by a tenaculum or by a silk ligature passed immediately
beneath the mucous membrane.</p>

<p>This point should be such that it may without undue
traction be drawn to either orifice of the vulvo-vaginal
glands.</p>

<table class="dual">
  <tr>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>If the apex of the rectocele is drawn to one side, there
is formed on the other side a triangular area (<a href="#fig_46">Fig. 46</a>, <i>a</i>,
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>). The base of this area (<i>a</i>, <i>c</i>) is at the ostium vaginæ.
The inner side (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) runs along the side of the rectocele.
The outer side (<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) runs along the lateral vaginal wall.
The apex <i>b</i> is approximately the highest point of the
tear in the sulcus. The angle <i>c</i> is immediately below
the orifice of the vulvo-vaginal gland. The angle <i>b</i> is
fixed by a tenaculum held by an assistant, and the triangular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
area is denuded. The denuded area does not
correspond exactly with the original tear in the sulcus,
but the denudation exposes the sulcus, so that sutures
may be passed in such a way as to include the muscles
and fascia. The sulcus on the opposite side is then
denuded in a similar manner, and the lower face of the
rectocele is denuded. It is best to begin the denudation
by seizing with tissue-forceps the mucous membrane of
the posterior vaginal wall at the ostium vaginæ, at the
junction of skin and mucous membrane, and to remove
contiguous strips of tissue by cutting upward toward the
apex of the vaginal sulcus (<a href="#fig_47">Fig. 47</a>).</p>

<p>The second suture is introduced about an eighth of an
inch from the edge of the mucous membrane on the left
vaginal wall, is passed backward, downward, and outward
so as to grasp retracted muscular fibers, and is made
to emerge at the bottom of the sulcus. It is then re-introduced
and passed forward between the mucous membrane
of the rectum and the denuded surface, and somewhat
upward, to emerge on the edge of the mucous
membrane of the rectocele. A third and, if necessary,

</table>

<p>The sutures thus far introduced are sufficient to close
the sulci, and therefore to restore the supporting structures
of the perineum. The remaining sutures are
merely to close the skin-perineum. The first of these
sutures is called the crown suture. The needle is introduced
on the cutaneous aspect of the perineum, at the
anterior end of the lateral denudation. It passes outside
of the denuded area, and emerges within the denuded
area, at the edge of the mucous membrane of the
vaginal wall, immediately below the last suture of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
sulcus. It is then passed so as to transfix the rectocele
beneath the mucous membrane, and across the lateral
denudation on the other side. When this suture is shotted
the fourchette is restored. A second suture behind the
crown suture is usually necessary to complete the closure
of the skin-perineum.</p>

<p>The sutures in the sulci are shotted first, then the external
sutures are shotted.</p>

<p>The second and third varieties of perineal injury are
sometimes found associated in women who have borne
more than one child, the injuries having in all probability
occurred at different labors. In such a case the sulci
should be denuded and closed as already described, and
then the skin-perineum and the sphincter ani should be
repaired.</p>

<p><b id="SUBCUTANEOUS_LACERATION_OF_THE_MUSCLES_AND_FASCIA">Subcutaneous Laceration of the Muscles and
Fascia.</b>&mdash;The fourth variety of injury to the perineum&mdash;subcutaneous
laceration of the muscles and fascia&mdash;is not
uncommon. The structures which compose the pelvic
floor are of different degrees of elasticity, and sometimes
the mucous membrane and skin at the vaginal outlet will
stretch, and not rupture, before the advancing head of
the child, while the underlying structures&mdash;the muscles
and fascia&mdash;may give way. Therefore the injury is said
to be a subcutaneous laceration. The sphincter ani is
never involved in this form of injury. The injury always
takes place in the direction of the vaginal sulci, and the
supporting muscles of the pelvic floor and the planes of
fascia are the structures which are torn. The disability
is exactly the same as in the third variety of perineal
tear, with the absence of laceration of mucous membrane
and skin.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that this injury will be positively
recognized at the time of labor, and therefore the
immediate operation cannot be applied to it. The condition
is often described as relaxation of the perineum.
The disabilities following this injury, and the tests by
which it may be recognized, are identical with those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
already described under old lacerations in the sulci.
The treatment is also the same. The vaginal sulci must
be denuded as though the mucous membrane had in
reality been torn, and the sutures must be introduced in
such a way as to bring back the muscles and the fascia
to the former attachments.

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_56" src="images/fig_56.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 56.</span>&mdash;Rectocele and cystocele.</p></div>

<p><b id="RECTOCELE">Rectocele.</b>&mdash;A rectocele (<a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56</a>) is the tumor formed
by the protrusion of the lower part of the posterior vaginal
wall into the vagina or
through the ostium vaginæ.
The condition is due to a
prolapse of the posterior
vaginal wall, and is caused
by the loss of the support
of the perineum, usually
the result of laceration at
childbirth. Sometimes the
mucous membrane of the
vagina alone prolapses, the
anterior wall of the rectum
remaining in place. Usually,
however, the anterior
rectal wall and the posterior
vaginal wall protrude together.
If the rectocele
is not so extensive as to
protrude through the ostium,
the woman may be
unaware of its existence. In many cases, however, the
prolapsing vaginal wall protrudes at the vulvar cleft when
the woman is erect, or when she strains at stool or performs
work requiring heavy lifting. The woman often
says that under such circumstances the “womb” protrudes.
On account of the accompanying prolapse of the
anterior rectal wall the passage of feces does not take
place in the normal direction, but the fecal mass is forced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
into the pouch of the anterior wall of the rectum, and
straining efforts push it forward into the vagina. The
woman says she feels as though the passages were about
to take place through the vagina. This discomfort is
relieved by pressing the rectocele back with the finger
during defecation. Accumulation of feces in the rectal
pouch may result in inflammation or ulceration. The
condition is readily recognized by introducing a finger
into the rectum, when it will be found to enter the
rectocele.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 57.</span>&mdash;Median sagittal section of the pelvis of a woman in whom there
has been a laceration of the perineum in the sulci, with rectocele and cystocele.
The vagina is no longer a closed slit.</p></div>

<p>A rectocele is cured by Emmet’s operation, which
restores the support of the perineum and the posterior
wall of the vagina.</p>

<p><b id="CYSTOCELE">Cystocele.</b>&mdash;A cystocele is a tumor formed by the protrusion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
of the lower part of the anterior vaginal wall into
the vagina or through the ostium (<a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56</a>). The prolapse
of the vaginal wall is accompanied by prolapse of
the posterior wall of the bladder. A sound introduced
into the bladder through the urethra will be found to
enter the cystocele. This test, and the soft, reducible
character of the cystocele tumor, enable us to diagnosticate
between cystocele and cyst of the anterior vaginal
wall. The condition is caused by a loss of the support
of the anterior vaginal wall that is furnished by the posterior
wall and the perineum.</p>

<p>In a case of cystocele residual urine often remains in
the pouch of the bladder-wall. In some cases the woman
learns that, in order to empty the bladder, it is necessary
for her to push the cystocele upward and forward at every
act of micturition. The result of this inability to empty
the bladder is decomposition of the urine and resulting
cystitis.</p>

<p>Many cases of so-called irritable bladder and chronic
cystitis are caused primarily by laceration of the perineum,
which produces cystocele or prolapse of the posterior
wall of the bladder; and such cases can be cured
only by curing the cystocele.</p>

<p>A cystocele varies much in size. Every long-standing
case of laceration of the perineum in the sulci presents
a certain degree of prolapse of the anterior vaginal wall.
The tumor may remain within the vagina and be rendered
prominent only upon efforts at straining, or it may protrude
through the vulva as a mass the size of a duck’s
egg.</p>

<p>As a cystocele is caused by laceration of the perineum,
it can be cured only by repair of this laceration. The
most important part of the treatment, therefore, is perineorrhaphy,
which should always be performed. Usually
this operation is sufficient. If the anterior wall of the
vagina is supported, the tissues will recover their tonicity
and contract, and the tumor will disappear.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, where the mucous membrane
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
of the anterior vaginal wall
has become much stretched
and redundant in the normal-sized
vagina, it is advisable,
in addition to the
perineorrhaphy, to perform
a plastic operation on the anterior
wall in order to diminish
the area of the vaginal
mucous membrane. Such
an operation is called anterior
colporrhaphy. A variety
of operations of this
kind have been invented.
The various forms are modified
according to the requirements of the case and the
whims of the operator. In one form of operation an
oval area is denuded (<a href="#fig_58">Fig. 58</a>), and the edges are brought
together by interrupted sutures
passed beneath the whole denuded
surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span>&mdash;Sims’ operation for
cystocele.</p>
</div>

<p>As the transverse measurement
of the vagina is greater
in the upper than in the lower
part, an operation by which a
greater amount of the excess
of tissue is taken in above
than below is often desirable.
Such an operation is represented
in <a href="#fig_59">Fig. 59</a>. Two strips,
about one-third to one-half
inch in breadth, are denuded
on each side of the anterior
wall, extending from the position
of the internal urinary meatus upward toward the
lateral vaginal fornices. The length of these strips varies
with the case, and depends upon the size of the upper
portion of the vagina. It is often desirable to carry the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
denudation to the level of the external os. The denuded
surfaces are brought into apposition by interrupted sutures.
By this operation the whole caliber of the vagina is narrowed
from above downward. The degree of divergence
of the denuded strips may be determined by seizing portions
of tissue with tenacula upon each side and bringing
them together, thus determining the amount of tension
which will be put upon the sutures.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span>&mdash;Dudley’s operation for cystocele (Ashton, modified from Dudley).</p></div>

<p>In Dudley’s operation the denudation is made and the
sutures are introduced as shown in <a href="#fig_60">Fig. 60</a>. The advantage
claimed for this operation is that by it the upper end
of the vaginal wall is attached to the bases of the broad
ligaments.</p>

<p>The operation of anterior colporrhaphy must always be
accompanied by perineorrhaphy. The anterior operation
should be performed first. The woman should be placed
in the Sims or the dorsal position.</p>

<p><b id="ENTEROCELE">Enterocele.</b>&mdash;Enterocele, or entero-vaginal hernia, is
a rare condition. It consists of a hernia, or prolapse, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
the intestine into the vaginal canal. Two forms of the
disease have been described&mdash;the anterior and the posterior.
The latter is the more common. In the posterior
variety one or more loops of the intestine, or the omentum,
reach the bottom of Douglas’s pouch and push
the posterior vaginal wall forward, so that it encroaches
upon the vaginal canal and in some cases protrudes from
the ostium vaginæ.</p>

<p>The causes of this disease are not known. It is probably
favored by loss of support of the perineum and the
vaginal walls. An unusually deep pouch of Douglas
would predispose a woman to this condition.</p>

<p>In the anterior form of the disease the hernia occurs at
the bottom of the vesico-uterine pouch.</p>

<p>The posterior enterocele may be distinguished from
rectocele by introducing a finger into the rectum and
one into the vagina, when the prolapsed intestine or
omentum may be felt between the anterior rectal wall
and the posterior vaginal wall. The condition may be
distinguished from vaginal cyst by percussion and palpation.</p>

<p>In the treatment of enterocele any existing injury to
the perineum should be repaired, and the vagina should
be narrowed by one of the plastic operations already described.
Great care should be taken not to injure with
the needle the intestine underlying the vaginal wall.</p>

<p><b id="SUBINVOLUTION_OF_THE_VAGINA">Subinvolution of the Vagina.</b>&mdash;It should be remembered,
in connection with the subject of prolapse of the
vaginal walls as a result of loss of the perineal support,
that there is always present, also, a condition of subinvolution
of the vagina. During pregnancy all the elements
of the vagina undergo a physiological hypertrophy
analogous to that which occurs in the uterus. After
labor the vagina normally undergoes certain changes by
which it is again approximately restored to the dimensions,
shape, etc. that existed before pregnancy. This
change is called the involution of the vagina. Anything
that arrests this process of involution produces a state of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
subinvolution of the vagina; this structure is then found
much larger and more relaxed than normal, and a certain
hypertrophy of all the elements of the vaginal walls
persists. Such subinvolution of the vagina is caused by
the various pelvic lacerations, which, by causing loss of
support to the pelvic vessels, result in a state of passive
congestion.</p>

<p>These redundant vaginal structures usually disappear
and contraction takes place after the operation of perineorrhaphy.
In some cases, however, when the vagina is
very much larger and more relaxed than normal, it is
advisable to remove some of the excess of tissue by a
plastic operation on the anterior wall similar to that
described for the relief of cystocele.

<h3 id="THE_POSITION_OF_THE_UTERUS_AND_THE_MECHANISM_OF_ITS_SUPPORT">THE POSITION OF THE UTERUS AND THE MECHANISM OF ITS SUPPORT.</h3>

<p>The uterus normally lies with its anterior surface in
contact with the posterior aspect of the bladder, no intestines
intervening. The absolute and relative positions
of the uterus depend upon the degree of distention
of the bladder and the position of the woman. The
uterus is pushed backward and the fundus is turned upward
by distention of the bladder. When the woman is
erect the uterus lies at a slightly lower level than when
the woman is on her back, and the intra-abdominal pressure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
acting upon the posterior surface of the fundus turns
the uterus more forward, so that the fundus lies nearer
the symphysis pubis. <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a> shows about the normal
range of position.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_61" src="images/fig_61.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span>&mdash;Normal range of position of the uterus, depending upon the distention
of the bladder.</p></div>

<p>It may be said that in the normal woman the long axis
of the uterus is approximately perpendicular to the long
axis of the vagina (<a href="#fig_62">Fig. 62</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_62" src="images/fig_62.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span>&mdash;Median sagittal section of the normal female pelvis.</p></div>

<p>The uterus does not surmount the vagina with the axes
of the two structures in the same line, as is shown in some
anatomical plates.</p>

<p>The cervix looks backward toward the coccyx, from
the tip of which it is situated 0.6 to 1.2 inches.</p>

<p>The uterus is maintained in position by a variety of
factors. The ligaments, which have been described, are
eight in number&mdash;broad ligaments, round ligaments,
utero-sacral and utero-vesical ligaments.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>With the exception of the round ligaments, which are
muscular structures, the uterine ligaments are formed by
peritoneal folds, including connective tissue, blood-vessels,
lymphatics, and a small amount of unstriped muscle.</p>

<p>When the woman is erect the insertions and origins of
the various uterine ligaments lie in the same horizontal
plane. The insertion of no ligament is higher than its
origin in the uterus; therefore these ligaments do not act
as suspensory ligaments when the uterus is in its normal
position. The truth of this fact is repeatedly demonstrated
at operations. If the cervix be caught with a
tenaculum when the woman is on her back, the uterus
may, with but very little force, be drawn downward
toward the ostium vaginæ to the extent of one or two
inches; and similarly, by a slight digital pressure on the
cervix, the uterus may be pushed upward from one to
two inches above its normal position.</p>

<p>The ligaments of the uterus act as guys. They steady
it, and prevent too great lateral and fore-and-aft movement;
they do not, when the uterus is in its normal position
or at its normal level, sustain it against the force of
gravity. When, however, the uterus, for any reason,
falls an inch or more below its normal level, the uterine
ligaments become suspensory in character.</p>

<p>In the normal woman the vagina is always closed. As
has already been said, it is a slit in the pelvic floor, valvular
in character; consequently the abdominal and pelvic
viscera may be considered to be contained in a closed
vessel, in woman as well as in man. The uterus floats in
this closed vessel at a level which is consistent with its
own specific gravity. If, for any reason, the specific
gravity of the uterus were increased, it would sink below
the level at which it is normally situated.</p>

<p>Since, normally, there is no tendency in the uterus to
change its position, the pressure upon it must be equal in
all directions. The subject may perhaps be better understood
by referring to a few simple facts in hydrostatics.
If a fluid contained in a closed vessel be in a condition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
of equilibrium so that its various particles are at rest,
then the pressure upon any particle is equal and opposite
in all directions (<a href="#fig_63">Fig. 63</a>); otherwise the particles would
not be in equilibrium, but would move. The bottom of
such a vessel, however, is not, like the particles of the
fluid, surrounded on all sides by the fluid, but above it is
the fluid, and below it is the atmospheric air. Any point
upon the bottom of the vessel is subjected to a downward
pressure equal to the weight of the column of fluid above
the point; this downward pressure is resisted by the
strength of the material composing the vessel. If this
material be yielding or elastic in character, the pressure
above will make the bottom protrude to a certain extent.
A particle within the fluid (like X immediately above the
bottom of the vessel) will be subjected to a downward
pressure equal to the weight of the column of fluid above
it; but this pressure will be counterbalanced not by any
strength in the particle, but by a counter-force acting
from below equal and opposite to that acting from above.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_63" src="images/fig_63.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span>&mdash;Vessel containing fluid in equilibrium. The arrows indicate the
direction of the pressure at various points.</p></div>

<p>A similar state of things exists in the female pelvis.
The uterus floats at a certain level, and the intra-abdominal
pressure acting from above is counterbalanced by an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
equal force acting from below, while the floor or bottom
of this vessel (part of which is the perineum) is subjected
to a force from above equal to the intra-abdominal pressure,
and this force is opposed only by the strength of the
perineum (see <a href="#fig_64">Fig. 64</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_64" src="images/fig_64.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span>&mdash;Diagram representing the directions of the intra-abdominal pressure
upon the uterus in the uninjured woman.</p></div>

<p>If the vagina were an open tube admitting air, so that
the uterus above was in contact with the contents of the
pelvic vessel and below with atmospheric air, then the
condition of things would be altered. In this case the
uterus would in reality become part of the floor of the
vessel, and would be subjected to a pressure from above
equal to the intra-abdominal pressure, and to this pressure
would be opposed only the strength of the uterus
and its attachments. Such a state of things occurs when
the perineum is torn and the vagina becomes a patulous
open canal, and not a closed slit. Therefore when the
opening of the vagina is torn and air constantly enters
the vaginal canal, the normal hydrostatic equilibrium of
the pelvic contents is destroyed, the resultant of the
forces acting upon the uterus is downward, and the
organ has a tendency to fall or to prolapse (<a href="#fig_65">Fig. 65</a>).</p>

<p>The normal perineum and vagina do not sustain the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
uterus by furnishing a mechanical support from below,
any more than the bottom of a vessel sustains any single
particle of fluid floating in it.</p>

<p>When the uterus tends to fall down or to prolapse, its
progress is opposed at a certain level by its various attachments.
The ligaments become suspensory in character as
soon as their uterine attachments are below their pelvic
attachments. The cellular tissue, fat, blood-vessels, etc.
connected with the uterus restrain its downward motion.
And, finally, this motion is restrained by what has been
called the “retentive power of the abdomen,” which is
merely the atmospheric pressure acting from below on
the contents of a vessel the top and sides of which are
closed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_65" src="images/fig_65.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span>&mdash;Diagram representing the direction of the intra-abdominal pressure in
the woman with a laceration of the perineum.</p></div>

<p>Refer again to a simple physical example: If a glass
tube be filled with water, a finger placed over one end,
and the tube inverted, the water will not run out: it is
sustained by atmospheric pressure acting from below.
If the finger be removed, atmospheric pressure also acts
from above, and the water will fall. If a hole be made
in the side of the tube, atmospheric pressure will act
through it, and the water below the hole will fall.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>In order that the column of water be sustained, the
sides of the tube must be rigid or unyielding. If the
sides of the tube yielded slightly to atmospheric pressure,
they would sink in and a certain amount of water
would escape.</p>

<p>The abdominal and pelvic cavities in the erect woman
may be considered as a tube filled with fluid contents.
The top of the tube is closed by the diaphragm; the sides
are the more or less rigid abdominal walls and the back;
the floor is the perineum. When the floor is destroyed a
hole is made in the bottom of the tube: the contents tend
to fall, but the fall is resisted by atmospheric pressure
acting from below. If the diaphragm and the parietes
were rigid as glass, there would be no prolapse, any more
than there is prolapse of the water in the glass tube. If
the parietes yield somewhat, the amount of fall or prolapse
is proportional. Thus the retentive power of the
abdomen is dependent upon the strength or rigidity of
the abdominal walls.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3 id="PROLAPSE_OF_THE_UTERUS">PROLAPSE OF THE UTERUS.</h3>

<p>Prolapse of the uterus means a falling of that organ
below its normal level. The condition is popularly
spoken of as “falling of the womb.” There are an
infinite number of degrees of prolapse of the uterus,
between the slightest descent on the one hand and
complete protrusion of the organ from the body on the
other hand. The term “complete prolapse” should
properly be applied to the entire protrusion of the
uterus outside of the vulva. This condition, however,
is most unusual. The term is generally used to designate
those cases in which the cervix alone, or the cervix
and part of the body of the uterus, protrude from the
vulva (<a href="#fig_66">Fig. 66</a>). In any case of prolapse of the uterus it
is best to describe in detail the extent of the prolapse and
the other conditions present. Thus, some of the various
kinds of prolapse may be described as follows: “Prolapse
of the uterus, the cervix resting on the pelvic
floor;” “prolapse of the uterus, the cervix presenting at
the vulvar cleft;” “prolapse of the uterus, the cervix
protruding about two inches from the ostium vaginæ,
with elongation of the supra-vaginal cervix,” etc.</p>

<p>Injury to the pelvic floor that allows air to enter the
vagina destroys the normal equilibrium of the pelvic
contents and exposes the uterus to a direct abdominal
pressure from above, which is not counterbalanced by an
equal force from below, but is opposed by the strength
of the uterus and its attachments and the retentive power
of the abdomen. Most cases of prolapse occur in women
in whom the perineum has been injured at childbirth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_66" src="images/fig_66.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span>&mdash;Prolapse of the uterus, the cervix protruding from the vulva. There
is a bilateral laceration of the cervix.</p></div>

<p>There are a number of predisposing causes of uterine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
prolapse that permit the descent to progress after the
uterus has begun to fall&mdash;namely: Relaxation of the
uterine ligaments that results from too frequent parturition,
from old age, or from tissue-weakness which is
part of a general condition, the uterine ligaments sharing
the general feebleness of the other tissues and structures
of the body; relaxation, loss of rigidity, or muscular
weakness of the abdominal parietes, which diminishes
the retentive power of the abdomen; diminution of the
cellular tissue and the fat of the pelvis, such as occurs in
wasting disease or in old age. Anything that suddenly
increases the intra-abdominal pressure, such as lifting a
heavy weight, may cause acute prolapse of the uterus.
In some cases the uterus has suddenly protruded from the
body as a result of heavy lifting. In cases of this character
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
it is probable that the muscular supports of the
perineum have been weakened from some cause, or that
the sudden increase of abdominal pressure drives the
uterus downward before the perineal muscles have time
to contract and close the vaginal outlet. In such cases
there is also present rupture of the uterine ligaments.
Constant violent coughing has produced uterine prolapse
in a similar way.</p>

<p>Extreme uterine prolapse sometimes occurs in a nulliparous
woman in whom the perineal supports are naturally
weak. In such women there exists a condition of
relaxation identical in results with subcutaneous laceration
of the perineum.</p>

<p>Anything that increases the specific gravity of the
uterus will make it sink somewhat lower in the pelvis.
Subinvolution, congestion from inflammation, or retroflexion
may do this. In such cases, however, the prolapse
never becomes extreme, rarely extending beyond a
slight sinking of the uterus.</p>

<p>In most cases uterine prolapse takes place slowly.
Sometimes many years are necessary for the development
of complete prolapse. The equilibrium of the
pelvic contents is destroyed by one of the causes already
mentioned. The uterus falls through a certain distance
before the uterine ligaments become suspensory. Then,
however, its further descent is impeded.</p>

<p>If the original cause continues to act, the uterine ligaments
become stretched and the descent of the uterus
gradually progresses, impeded to a varying degree also
by the retentive power of the abdomen and the cellular
tissue and other pelvic attachments.</p>

<p>As the uterus descends, the vaginal walls attached at
the cervix are dragged down with it, so that when the
prolapse becomes complete the vagina is turned inside
out (<a href="#fig_67">Fig. 67</a>).</p>

<p>When the perineum has been injured so that the lower
portion of the vagina loses its support and the equilibrium
of the pelvic contents is destroyed, two distinct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
phenomena occur: The uterus falls as already described,
and at the same time the lower part of the vagina begins
to fall, so that there appear a prolapse of the anterior vaginal
wall, or a cystocele, and a prolapse of the posterior
wall, or a rectocele. The condition finally produced will
depend upon which prolapse takes place the more rapidly&mdash;that
of the vagina or that of the uterus.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_67" src="images/fig_67.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>&mdash;Complete prolapse of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>If the prolapse of the lower vagina progresses faster
than that of the uterus, then the vagina will begin to
drag upon the cervix, to which it is attached, and under
these circumstances the uterus will be subjected to two
downward forces&mdash;intra-abdominal pressure from above,
and traction of the vaginal walls acting from below.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_68" src="images/fig_68.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span>&mdash;Prolapse of the vagina and the vaginal cervix, with great elongation
of the supra-vaginal cervix.</p></div>

<p>As the traction is exerted upon the lower part of the
cervix, and the body of the uterus is sustained by the
uterine ligaments, which resist the downward traction,
the isthmus, or point of junction of the body and cervix,
is dragged out or stretched, so that in some cases a very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
marked elongation of the supra-vaginal cervix, or the
part of the cervix above the vaginal junction, appears.
This elongation is sometimes so great that the length of
the uterine cavity from external os to fundus measures
six or eight inches. Such elongation of the cervix is
usually found to a greater or less degree in every case of
marked prolapse of the uterus caused by injury to the
perineum. Such a condition should be described as prolapse
of the uterus with elongation of the supra-vaginal
cervix (<a href="#fig_68">Fig. 68</a>). In many cases the prolapse of the vagina
and the elongation of the cervix are the most marked
features, the body of the uterus falling but slightly below
its normal level. The cervix will be found protruding
some distance from the vulva; the vagina will be found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
turned inside out; while the fundus may be felt approximately
at its normal level in the pelvis, and the presenting
cervix and the body of the uterus are connected by
a round, cord-like structure about the size of the little
finger, which is the stretched, attenuated supra-vaginal
cervix.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_69" src="images/fig_69.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>&mdash;Prolapse of the vagina and cervix, with elongation of the supra-vaginal
cervix.</p></div>

<p>As a result of the traction upon the cervix the blood-flow
from the infra-vaginal cervix is impeded, and passive
congestion results in hypertrophy. This hypertrophy is
increased by irritation of the infra-vaginal cervix from
friction against the clothing and from urine, etc. In
such cases the presenting cervix becomes much larger
than normal, sometimes measuring two or two and a
half inches in diameter.</p>

<p>It will be seen that very pronounced structural changes
are present in old cases of prolapse of the uterus. The
uterine ligaments and the pelvic attachments become so
stretched and atrophied that they can never become functionally
useful again. The normal shape and size of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
uterus become very much changed from elongation of
the supra-vaginal cervix and hypertrophy of the infra-vaginal
cervix. The vaginal canal becomes patulous
and stretched several times beyond its normal dimensions,
and the delicate mucous membrane, from exposure,
becomes tough and cutaneous in character. The large
protruding mass of uterus and inverted vagina stretches
the genital outlet far beyond its normal dimensions, and
the muscular supports that may have remained after the
original perineal injury undergo atrophy from pressure.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_70" src="images/fig_70.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>&mdash;Prolapse of the vagina and the vaginal cervix, with elongation of the
supravaginal cervix. Extensive ulceration.</p></div>

<p>Accompanying the prolapse of the uterus is usually
prolapse of the bladder and of the anterior wall of the
rectum, producing a condition already described under
Cystocele and Rectocele.</p>

<p>Women who do hard manual labor are those who suffer
with the most marked forms of uterine prolapse. The
form of prolapse accompanied by elongation of the supra-vaginal
cervix is usually characteristic of the hard-working
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
woman. Such prolapse of the uterus is common
among the Western Indian women, who return immediately
after delivery to hard labor and horseback-riding.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_70a" src="images/fig_70a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70</span>, <i>A</i>.&mdash;Elongation of supra-vaginal cervix (St. Bartholomew’s Hospital
Museum).</p></div>

<p>Many cases of prolapse would be avoided, even though
there might be serious perineal injury, if women remained
in bed a sufficient time after delivery. By rising too early
prolapse is favored, for a variety of reasons. The uterus
is large and heavy; the uterine ligaments are elongated,
and the abdominal walls are weak; consequently the
retentive power of the abdomen is poor; the vagina is
flabby and much larger than normal; the genital outlet
has not contracted, and the muscular and fascial supports
which may not have been torn are stretched and relaxed.</p>

<p>The subjective <b>symptoms</b> of prolapse vary greatly and
are not characteristic. A woman in whom the uterus has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
descended but slightly below the normal level may suffer
so much with backache, weakness of the legs, and a feeling
of pelvic weight, or “bearing down,” that her life
will be rendered useless; while, on the other hand, a
woman with complete prolapse of the uterus may suffer
no inconvenience except from the presence of the protruding
mass. In fact, the lesser degrees of prolapse seem
to cause more suffering than the extreme degrees.</p>

<p>The first subjective symptoms of injury to the supports
of the pelvic floor that appear when the woman leaves
her bed are those referable to beginning prolapse of the
uterus. Backache is the most common symptom, and
occurs here as in almost every other disease of the uterus.
The pain, a dull ache, is situated in the upper part of
the sacrum. It is increased by standing, by walking, or
by manual labor. It often disappears entirely when the
woman lies down and the intra-abdominal pressure is
removed from the uterus. Headache situated in the
occipital region or the vertex is also usually present, and
varies in severity with the severity of the backache.</p>

<p>Pain extending down the posterior aspect of the thighs,
and a dragging feeling of loss of support in the pelvis,
may also be present. The rectal and bladder symptoms
occur later, when rectocele and cystocele appear.</p>

<p>There is often very marked general physical weakness,
much of which may be referred directly to the loss of the
muscular support of the perineum. Almost every effort
that the woman makes is accompanied by increase of
intra-abdominal pressure, and she feels keenly the loss
of the accustomed perineal support which normally
resists any increased abdominal pressure. In the sound
woman the perineal muscles contract and the vagina is
more tightly closed to meet the increased pressure incident
to a muscular effort. In the injured woman the
vagina is open and the pressure is resisted by weak
vaginal walls and uterine supports. She feels that her
point of resistance is gone. The best proof of the profound
effect of injury to the perineum upon the general
strength of a woman is given by the operation of perineorrhaphy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
The repair of this apparently slight lesion
restores the woman to her former strength.</p>

<p>The <b>diagnosis</b> of prolapse of the uterus is readily
made by examination. In the extreme cases the cervix
and the greater part of the body of the uterus are found
outside the vulva. In less marked cases the cervix
is seen presenting at the vaginal orifice as soon as the
labia are separated. In other cases the cervix is felt by
the vaginal finger resting on the pelvic floor. It should
be remembered that every case of prolapse is greater
when the woman is standing than when she is being
examined upon her back. Sometimes the cervix will
present at the vulva, where it may be felt when the
woman is erect; but when she lies down and intra-abdominal
pressure is removed, it retreats beyond inspection
except through the speculum. In order to determine
the full extent of prolapse, therefore, when the woman is
examined on her back she should be directed to strain or
bear down, when much more marked descent of the
uterus and vaginal walls will become apparent.</p>

<p>The lesser degrees of prolapse, in which the cervix has
not yet fallen enough to rest on the pelvic floor, are more
difficult to recognize by bimanual examination. It will
be found that the upward range of motion of the uterus
is greater than normal, and vaginal examination when
the woman is erect will make the condition more
apparent.</p>

<p>Extreme prolapse of the uterus, in which we find protruding
from the vulva a pear-shaped tumor at the apex
of which is the opening of the cervical canal, should not
be mistaken for any other condition. Inversion of the
uterus and a uterine polyp resemble it only in shape, and
in no other particular. If there is any doubt, it may be
dispelled by placing the woman in the knee-chest position,
when the prolapse may readily be reduced and the
normal anatomical relations restored.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;As prolapse of the uterus is usually caused
by injury to the pelvic floor, treatment should be directed
in the first place to the restoration of the perineum.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>In slight cases of prolapse that are seen early, restoration
of the perineum by Emmet’s operation is sufficient
for cure.</p>

<p>In cases of long duration, however, we have to deal
with a variety of secondary conditions. These are as
follows: Hypertrophy of the uterus from subinvolution
or congestion; elongation of the cervix; hypertrophy of
the cervix; elongation of the uterine ligaments; stretching
of the vagina; stretching of the genital outlet; and
atrophy of all the structures of the perineum from pressure.
The atrophic changes give the most difficulty.
The prognosis, therefore, depends upon the duration of
the case.</p>

<p>In cases of prolapse in which the cervix has reached or
has passed the ostium vaginæ, rest in bed in the recumbent
position should always be prescribed for two to four
weeks before any operative procedure. The woman
should be placed in the knee-chest position and the prolapse
of the uterus and vagina should be reduced. Reduction
of this kind should be practised as often as the
prolapse returns&mdash;as, for instance, after straining at stool.
It may be performed by the woman herself or by the
nurse. It is well for the woman to assume the knee-chest
position three or four times a day, for five to
fifteen minutes at a time. One or two hot vaginal
douches of a gallon of 1:4000 bichloride solution
should be administered daily. The intestinal contents
should be kept soft by laxatives. As a result of such
preparatory treatment the uterus will diminish very much
in size, and the vagina and the vaginal outlet will contract,
so that at the time of operating the amount of tissue
to be removed may be more accurately determined. The
diminution in the length of an elongated cervix as a
result of rest is most striking, and demonstrates the truth
of the explanation of the etiology of this condition that
has already been given. A uterine canal that measures
five or six inches in length may be reduced to three or
four inches after traction on the cervix has been removed
by rest in bed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>Ulceration of the cervix, which is often present as a
result of friction from exposure, readily yields to this
treatment of rest and douches.</p>

<p>From the considerations already referred to it will
be seen that the operative treatment of any case of uterine
prolapse varies according to the special conditions
present.</p>

<p>Perineorrhaphy is always necessary. Emmet’s operation
is usually the best one. The denudation in the
lateral vaginal sulci should be extended well up the posterior
vaginal wall, in order to diminish the caliber of
the overstretched vagina. One of the operations already
described should also be performed for the cure of the
cystocele and to diminish the area of the anterior vaginal
wall. The best of these operations are Sims’ and
Dudley’s (Figs. 59 and 60). After all plastic operations
for the cure of prolapse the woman should be kept in bed
for three or four weeks&mdash;the longer the better&mdash;so that
the perineal and vaginal structures and the ligaments of
the uterus may contract and regain strength.</p>

<p>In some cases of long standing it is impossible, by
operation, to restore the integrity of the pelvic floor, and
to restore the shape, size, and direction of the vaginal
canal so that the normal equilibrium of the pelvic contents
will be re-established. In such cases operators have
attempted to build a direct mechanical support for the
uterus.</p>

<p>Le Fort’s operation is an ingenious method of attaining
this object. The uterus should be replaced, and a
longitudinal strip of tissue, about one-half to one inch in
breadth and two to two and a half inches in length,
should be denuded on the anterior vaginal wall, extending
from a point near the vulva, where the two vaginal
walls are in contact when the uterus is in place, up toward
the cervix. A similar strip should be denuded on
the posterior wall. These two denuded areas should be
brought into apposition by interrupted sutures passed
transversely. Perineorrhaphy should also be performed.</p>

<p>In those cases in which the vagina and the vaginal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
outlet have become very much stretched by the protruding
mass of prolapsed structures, Emmet’s operation
seems to be insufficient. In such cases the following
operation is useful. This consists in denuding a triangular
area on the posterior vaginal wall (<a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a>),
the apex of the denudation being immediately below the
cervix, and the base at the ostium vaginæ. The denudation
should extend well on to the lateral vaginal walls.
The denuded area is then closed by sutures passed transversely.</p>

<p>Judgment, derived from experience, is necessary in
choosing and performing the various plastic operations
for prolapse of the uterus.</p>

<p>In every case of prolapse a certain degree of retroversion
of the uterus is present. In fact, the uterus could
not escape from the vagina unless the fundus were turned
somewhat backward. The operation of ventro-fixation
of the uterus is therefore a useful adjunct in some cases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
of uterine prolapse. The operation is not intended to
furnish a mechanical support to the uterus, but only to
keep it in a position of anteversion, so that it will less
readily escape through the vaginal canal. The plastic
operations and the ventro-suspension may all be done at
the same sitting.</p>

<p>In those very rare cases of incurable prolapse that
have resisted all conservative treatment the operation for
the removal of the uterus may be considered. The writer
has never resorted to it. The operation consists in supra-vaginal
hysterectomy followed by fixation of the cervical
stump by sutures to the abdominal wall.</p>

<p>This operation, however, should not be proposed hastily.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
The surgeon should not become discouraged by one
or even two failures of the more conservative methods of
treatment. Though the first plastic operation may fail
to retain the uterus inside the body, yet something is always
accomplished by it, and when supplemented by a
second or a third operation, cure will often result.</p>

<p>The operative procedures required in a case of prolapse
of the vagina and of the infra-vaginal cervix, with
hypertrophy of the infra-vaginal cervix and elongation
of the supra-vaginal cervix, are illustrated in <a href="#fig_71">Figs. 71</a>-<a href="#fig_78">78</a>.</p>

<p>The condition represented in <a href="#fig_71">Fig. 71</a> is that which is
commonly spoken of as “prolapse of the uterus.” It is
the usual form of prolapse. It may be cured in the very
great majority of cases by the operations which are here
depicted.</p>

<p>A great number of mechanical devices have been introduced
for the relief of prolapse of the uterus. Every
vaginal pessary has been used for this condition. None
of these implements cure the disease. All of them, if
used continuously, produce ulceration of the vagina and
of the cervix from pressure, and must be abandoned until
such lesions heal. In those cases of prolapse in which pessaries
remain in the vagina and support the uterus, without
producing ulceration, operation would effect a cure.</p>

<p>Mechanical supports of this kind are only indicated in

Perhaps the best instrument
for supporting the uterus
in such cases is Braun’s colpeurynter
(<a href="#fig_79">Fig. 79</a>). The uterus
should be reduced, and the colpeurynter,
well greased and containing
about an ounce of water,
should be introduced in the vagina and then distended
with air. This instrument takes its support evenly from
all parts of the vaginal outlet, and is therefore less apt to
produce ulceration from pressure than the various pessaries.
It should be removed at night.

<h3 id="ANTEFLEXION_OF_THE_UTERUS">ANTEFLEXION OF THE UTERUS.</h3>

<p>As has already been said, the uterus normally lies with
its anterior surface in contact with the posterior surface
of the bladder, and with its long axis approximately perpendicular
to the long axis of the vagina. The forward
inclination of the uterus varies with the degree of distention
of the bladder; it is greatest when the bladder is
collapsed.</p>

<p>In the normal woman the long axis of the body of the
uterus is inclined forward at an obtuse angle with the
long axis of the cervix. In other words, the uterus is
normally anteflexed. This angle is subject to rather wide
variations within the limits of health. It is greater in
the multiparous than in the nulliparous woman. It varies
with the distention of the bladder, the position of the
woman, and the intensity of intra-abdominal pressure.
The axis of the uterus when removed from the body is
usually straight. The anteflexion found in the organ
when <i>in situ</i> in the living woman rarely persists. The
normal or physiological anteflexion is maintained during
life by the utero-sacral ligaments, which hold the cervix
back, and the intra-abdominal pressure, which, acting
upon the posterior aspect of the fundus, pushes the body
of the uterus forward.</p>

<p>In the fetus and in early infancy the cervix is relatively
much more developed than the body of the uterus,
and there is a very marked angle of flexion between
them.</p>

<p>Anteflexion of the uterus becomes pathological when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the bend in the cervical canal is sufficient to impede the
escape of menstrual blood or other uterine discharges.</p>

<p>Obstruction of this kind depends upon two factors&mdash;the
degree of the flexion, and the rigidity of the uterus,
which diminishes the mobility that normally exists at
the angle of flexion.</p>

<p>No matter how sharp the angle of flexion, it should
not be considered a pathological condition unless obstruction
in the cervical canal is present&mdash;unless the woman
presents the symptoms of dysmenorrhea and sterility.</p>

<p>Three varieties of anteflexion have been described:</p>

<p>I. <i>Corporeal anteflexion</i>, in which the cervix has the
normal backward direction, and the body of the uterus is
bent forward upon it (<a href="#fig_80">Fig. 80</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_80" src="images/fig_80.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.</span>&mdash;Corporeal anteflexion.</p></div>

<p>II. <i>Cervical anteflexion</i>, in which the axis of the body
of the uterus is inclined forward to the normal degree,
and the cervix is bent forward upon it (<a href="#fig_81">Fig. 81</a>).</p>

<p>III. <i>Cervico-corporeal anteflexion</i>, when the cervix and
body of the uterus are both bent forward upon each other
(<a href="#fig_82">Fig. 82</a>).</p>

<p>Anteflexion of the uterus is a disease of single and
sterile married women. It is very rarely found in women
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
who have borne children. The disease is congenital or
is caused by imperfect development during childhood.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_81" src="images/fig_81.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.</span>&mdash;Cervical anteflexion.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_82" src="images/fig_82.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 82.</span>&mdash;Cervico-corporeal anteflexion.</p></div>

<p>The fetal condition of a large cervix and a small,
sharply-flexed body may persist. The posterior wall of
the uterus may develop while the development of the
anterior wall is arrested, and thus the uterus would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
flexed forward. A mark of such arrest of development
is sometimes seen in the atrophied or undeveloped anterior
lip of the cervix. Anteflexion is usually accompanied
by a small, undeveloped condition of the whole of
the uterus, and often by poorly developed vagina, tubes,
and ovaries.</p>

<p>It is probable that improper dress and hygiene during
the period of puberty have much to do with the development
of anteflexion. The early menstrual history sometimes
points to poor development of the sexual organs.
The menses often make their appearance much later than
usual&mdash;sometimes when a girl is nineteen or twenty years
of age&mdash;and when established, the function is often
irregular, the bleeding recurring at long intervals.</p>

<p>The most prominent <b>symptom</b> of anteflexion of the
uterus is dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation. The
dysmenorrhea is characteristic: violent pains in the center
of the lower abdomen, extending down the thighs, occur
for several hours before the bleeding begins. In the later
years of the disease the pain extends to the whole of the
pelvis and the back. The pain is caused, in all probability,
by the accumulation of blood behind the obstruction
in the cervical canal. When the blood begins to
escape freely, the pain is relieved, and may be absent
during the remainder of the menstrual period. The
blood is often clotted during the first part of the flow.
Nausea and vomiting may be present during the height
of the pain.</p>

<p>The menstrual period may be followed by several days
of great physical weakness and debility.</p>

<p>Unless relieved by pregnancy or by proper treatment,
the anteflexion will persist during the menstrual life of
the woman. The suffering increases with time. Endometritis,
salpingitis, and ovaritis follow old cases of anteflexion.</p>

<p>Sterility usually accompanies well-marked anteflexion.
This may be due to the altered direction of the cervix in
case of cervical anteflexion, to the obstruction in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
cervical canal that interferes with the ingress of spermatozoa,
to the generally undeveloped condition of the
genital organs, or to the inflammation of the mucous
membrane of the cervix and the body of the uterus.</p>

<p>The <b>diagnosis</b> of anteflexion is easily made. The character,
position, and time of onset of the pain indicate
some obstruction to the escape of menstrual blood. Vaginal
examination reveals the sharp angle of flexion at the
junction of the body and neck of the uterus.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;If in a case of anteflexion pregnancy
does occur and runs a normal course the disease will be
cured. After labor the uterus does not return to the
infantile shape and size. The stimulus of pregnancy
brings about full permanent development of that organ.
Miscarriage, however, is very apt to occur during the
early months of pregnancy, especially in cases of long
standing.</p>

<p>Various methods of treatment have been introduced
for the cure of anteflexion. The object of all these
methods is the straightening and enlargement of the
cervical canal. Slow dilatation by graduated bougies
has been successfully employed. Gradual straightening
of the canal by the introduction of the uterine sound
with increasing angle of flexion will also cure some
cases, if seen early.</p>

<p>The use of the stem pessary (<a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83</a>),
which is worn continuously in the cervical
canal, is dangerous and should not be
practised.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_83" src="images/fig_83.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 83.</span>&mdash;Stem
pessary.</p></div>

<p>The best method of treatment consists
in rapid forcible dilatation with the uterine
dilator. Various instruments have
been made for this purpose. The principle
of all is the same. Two blades are
introduced, in contact, in the cervical
canal, and are then separated. Two of these instruments
should be on hand&mdash;a small and a large dilator.
The Goodell dilator (Figs. 84, 85) is so made that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
blades open parallel with one another, so that the whole
of the cervical canal is uniformly stretched.</p>

<table class="dual">
  <tr>
    <td><img id="fig_84" src="images/fig_84.jpg" alt="" />
    <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.</span>&mdash;Goodell’s small uterine dilator.</p></td>

    <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.</span>&mdash;Goodell’s large uterine
    dilator.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The best time to perform forcible dilatation is about
one week after a menstrual period. The woman should
be etherized and placed in the dorso-sacral position. The
vagina should be sterilized. All aseptic precautions which
one would follow in any gynecological operation should
be observed here. There is always danger of producing
septic inflammation of the endometrium. The cervix
should be exposed through the Sims speculum, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
anterior lip should be seized with the double tenaculum.
Downward traction on the cervix straightens the cervical
canal and renders easier the introduction of the dilator.
The smaller dilator should first be introduced. No force
should be used in passing it through the cervical canal.
If an obstruction which cannot be gently overcome is
met, the dilator should be introduced as far as the obstruction
and the blades should then be separated.
Slight dilatation of this kind below the angle of flexion
will usually enable the operator to pass the instrument
through the cervical canal at a subsequent attempt.
After the smaller instrument has been introduced to the
full extent the blades should be gradually separated, for
a half inch or more, until the canal becomes large and
straight enough to admit the large instrument. It should
always be remembered that no force should be used in
the introduction of either instrument. After introduction
the blades of the large dilator should be slowly separated.
On the handles of the Goodell instrument is a graduated
scale showing the extent of the dilatation. In no case
should the dilatation be carried beyond one and a half
inches. In women in whom the cervix and uterus are
small an inch of dilatation is sufficient. The maximum
dilatation should be reached slowly and gradually. Laceration
of the cervix or of the margin of the external os
should be avoided. Sometimes ten or fifteen minutes are
required before full dilatation is attained. When this
point is reached the handles should be held in place by
the screw, and the instrument should be kept in the
uterus for ten or fifteen minutes longer. The longer
the dilatation, the more permanent will be the result.</p>

<p>After the instrument is withdrawn the cervical canal
and the vagina should be washed out with a 1:2000 solution
of bichloride of mercury, and a light gauze pack
should be introduced into the vagina. The pack should
be removed at the end of forty-eight hours, and a daily
douche of 1:4000 bichloride solution should be administered
for the following week. The patient should remain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
in bed for two weeks, or longer if there is any pelvic
pain. Pain, however, does not follow this operation if
we avoid operating upon those cases in which there is
inflammatory disease of the tubes and ovaries. The too
early resumption of the erect position may cause the failure
of the operation. The abdominal pressure exerted
upon the fundus uteri, before the organ has become
fixed in its altered shape, may bring about a recurrence
of the anteflexion. In case the external os be very small&mdash;too
small to admit the dilators&mdash;it may be incised by
small crucial incisions or reamed out with the closed
blades of the scissors.</p>

<p>Dilatation of this kind usually produces a permanent
broadening and shortening of the cervix. The cervical
canal is rendered straighter and larger.</p>

<p>The good effects of the operation are not always apparent
at the menstrual period immediately following the
operation, because the results of the traumatism to the
mucous membrane and the structures of the cervix are
still present. At the periods after this, however, the
dysmenorrhea is absent or is very much relieved. The
benefit usually derived from this operation is a strong
proof of the truth of the obstructive theory of the dysmenorrhea.
If, after dilatation, conception takes place,
the woman may look forward to perfect cure. In some
cases the dilatation does not seem to be sufficient to produce
a permanent open condition of the cervical canal,
and the signs of obstruction (dysmenorrhea) return. In
such a case the dilatation should be repeated. The more
thoroughly the dilatation is performed the first time the
less often will the second operation be necessary.

<h3 id="RETROFLEXION_AND_RETROVERSION_OF_THE_UTERUS">RETROFLEXION AND RETROVERSION OF THE UTERUS.</h3>

<p><b>Retroversion</b> of the uterus means a turning back or
a backward rotation of that organ. The shape of the
uterus may not be altered. The fundus, instead of lying
forward upon the bladder, is directed backward, and
sometimes lies in the hollow of the sacrum (<a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_86" src="images/fig_86.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 86.</span>&mdash;Retroversion of the uterus.</p></div>

<p><b>Retroflexion</b> means a bending backward of the uterine
axis. The axis of the body of the uterus is normally
inclined forward at an obtuse angle with the axis of the
cervix. When the axis of the body of the uterus is inclined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
backward at an angle with the axis of the cervix,
retroflexion exists. Retroflexion may vary in extent from
an angle very little less than 180 degrees to an angle considerably
less than 90 degrees (<a href="#fig_87">Fig. 87</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_87" src="images/fig_87.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.</span>&mdash;Retroflexion of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>Retroflexion and retroversion usually coexist. The
conditions are due to similar causes. They may originate
simultaneously, or one condition, occurring primarily,
may induce the other.</p>

<p>An infinite number of degrees of retroversion may
exist. For convenience of clinical description three
degrees have been described. In the first degree the
fundus uteri is directed upward approximately toward
the promontory of the sacrum. In the second degree
the uterus lies transversely across the pelvis, the fundus
and the cervix being at about the same level. In the
third degree the retroversion is extreme, and the fundus
lies below the level of the cervix (<a href="#fig_88">Fig. 88</a>).</p>

<p>Retroversion of the uterus is progressive. It usually
proceeds from bad to worse. As soon as the downward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
abdominal pressure begins to act upon the anterior face
of the uterus there is a continuous force increasing the
retroversion.</p>

<p>There are many causes of retroversion and retroflexion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_88" src="images/fig_88.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 88.</span>&mdash;Diagram of the degrees of retroversion of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>The disease may be congenital. Extreme retroflexion
has been found in the uterus of the new-born infant.
Congenital retroversion and retroflexion may be due to
imperfect development, and resulting imperfect invagination
of the cervix. The condition may also be caused by
arrest of development of the posterior wall of the uterus;
the anterior wall thus outgrowing the posterior.</p>

<p>Many cases of retroversion undoubtedly originate during
girlhood as a result of falls, blows, distortion of the
body, or sudden efforts at lifting. The origin of the
symptoms may be traced in many cases directly to some
such cause.</p>

<p>The uterus may be considered to be balanced upon an
axis running transversely. Anything that turns the
uterus backward, so that the intra-abdominal pressure
may act upon the anterior wall, will produce retroversion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
It is probable that an over-distended bladder occasionally
acts as a cause of retroversion.</p>

<p>Retroversion is not at all rare in single women. It
is very often discovered soon after the establishment of
the menstrual function, the symptoms of the retroversion,
which probably occurred during girlhood, first
appearing at this time. Retroflexion, on the other
hand, except to the slight extent caused by the retroversion,
is unusual in single women.</p>

<p>Parturition is probably the most frequent cause of
retroversion and retroflexion of the uterus. If the woman
leaves her bed or goes to work too soon after miscarriage
or labor, many conditions are present that favor retrodisplacement
of the uterus. The uterus is larger and heavier
than normal, as a result of imperfect involution: the
uterine ligaments are lax; the vagina and the vaginal
orifice are relaxed, and the support of the pelvic floor is
consequently deficient; the abdominal walls are relaxed
and the retentive power of the abdomen is diminished.
It will be remembered that these are the causes that favor
prolapse of the uterus; in fact, a slight degree of uterine
prolapse usually accompanies such cases of retrodisplacement.
A certain amount of retroversion must always
exist before the uterus can pass along the vagina. It
must turn backward, so that its axis becomes parallel to
the axis of the vagina.</p>

<p>Retroflexion occurring after miscarriage or labor is
sometimes the result of unequal involution in the uterine
walls. If the involution takes place more completely
in the posterior than in the anterior wall of the uterus, a
bending back, or a retroflexion, will occur. Such inequality
of involution may result from inflammation about the
site of the placenta.</p>

<p>Retroflexion is a disease of the parous woman, as anteflexion
is a disease of the single and the sterile woman.</p>

<p>Retroversion may be a direct result of laceration of
the perineum. When the pelvic floor is destroyed and
the posterior vaginal wall begins to prolapse, it drags
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
upon the posterior wall of the cervix, and may in this
way turn the uterus backward.</p>

<p>Retroversion also results from traction of inflammatory
adhesions in the pelvis. Cases of chronic inflammation
of the Fallopian tubes accompanied by inflammation of
the pelvic peritoneum present adhesions between the posterior
wall of the uterus and the hollow of the sacrum;
these adhesions drag the uterus backward (<a href="#fig_89">Fig. 89</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_89" src="images/fig_89.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.</span>&mdash;Retroversion of the uterus, with adhesions binding it to the anterior
wall of the rectum and the hollow of the sacrum.</p></div>

<p>In cases of retroversion and retroflexion of the uterus
serious derangement of the circulation results. A state
of passive congestion follows interference with the venous
supply. This congestion produces some enlargement
of the uterus and chronic congestion or inflammation
of the endometrium. Consequently, in all old
cases of retrodisplacement endometritis is an accompaniment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>Retroversion of the uterus causes traction on the vesico-uterine
connection, and the neck of the bladder is
dragged upon; for this reason irritability of the bladder,
characterized by frequent and perhaps painful micturition,
is often present in cases of retroversion. It is not
uncommon to see women who have received treatment
directed to the bladder for conditions of this kind that
disappear immediately when the uterus is restored to the
normal position.</p>

<p>The pressure of the displaced fundus upon the rectum
may also give trouble. Women in this condition often
complain of a feeling of obstruction in the rectum.
Pressure upon the hemorrhoidal veins results in hemorrhoids.</p>

<p>There usually accompanies retroversions of the uterus
a backward and downward displacement of the ovaries&mdash;in
other words, a prolapse of the ovaries.</p>

<p>The <b>symptoms</b> of retrodisplacement are numerous,
and may be referred directly to the altered position of
the uterus and the accompanying conditions. There are
backache situated in the upper part of the sacrum, and
headache situated on the top of the head or in the occiput.
These may be considered the two constant symptoms.
There is a feeling of weight and dragging in the
pelvis, extending down the thighs. Physical weakness,
or inability to walk or stand for more than a short time,
is often very marked, and seems to be out of all proportion
to the lesion of the uterus. The manner in which
such weakness of the legs is produced is not very evident.
That it is caused directly by the displacement
of the uterus, however, is proved by the fact that it disappears
as soon as the uterus is restored to its normal
position.</p>

<p>The accompanying prolapse of the ovaries produces
symptoms referable to these organs, the chief symptom
being pain in each ovarian region.</p>

<p>The irritability of the bladder has already been spoken
of. Menorrhagia and leucorrhea may be present as a result
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
of the congestion and the chronic inflammation of
the endometrium. Menstruation is usually painful. At
the menstrual period the backache, headache, ovarian
pain, and vesical disturbance are increased. Dysmenorrhea
due to obstruction is unusual in cases of retroflexion.
Retroflexion usually occurs in parous women,
in whom the cervical canal is large, and the flexion
therefore does not cause sufficient obstruction to impede
the escape of menstrual blood. All the symptoms arising
from retroversion of the uterus are ameliorated by
the recumbent posture.</p>

<p>The <b>diagnosis</b> of retroversion and retroflexion of the
uterus is very easily made by bimanual examination.
The abdominal hand fails to find the fundus in the
normal position. The vaginal finger feels the cervix
uteri directed not backward toward the coccyx, but forward
in the direction of the vaginal axis or toward the
symphysis pubis. The posterior wall of the cervix and
the body of the uterus may be plainly felt inclined backward.
In case of retroflexion the angle of flexion may
be felt by the vaginal finger.</p>

<p>The accompanying prolapse of the ovaries is usually
very easily demonstrated by vaginal touch.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;As retroflexion does not usually cause
obstruction of the menstrual flow, the treatment need not
be directed toward rendering patulous the cervical canal,
as in the case of anteflexion. Retroflexion is always associated
with retroversion, and the methods that correct
the retroversion place the uterus in such a position that
the intra-abdominal pressure acts on the posterior face
of the uterus and gradually reduces the flexion. Therefore
the treatment of retroflexion and of retroversion may
be considered together.</p>

<p>Retroversion is treated by the vaginal pessary and by
operation.</p>

<p><i>The vaginal pessary</i> is an instrument to be worn in the
vagina, and designed to retain the uterus in its normal
position. A great many different kinds of pessaries have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
been invented. The large number of different-shaped
instruments proves the inefficacy of the pessary as a
means of treatment in many cases of retroversion.</p>

<p>The best pessaries for retroversion are the Hodge (<a href="#fig_90">Fig.
90</a>, <small>A</small>), the Smith (<a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90</a>, <small>B</small>), and the Thomas (<a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90</a>,
<small>C</small>). These instruments are made of hard rubber. They
consist of an upper and a lower transverse bar joined by
two lateral bars. They are so shaped that when introduced
into the vagina they correspond very closely to the
curvature of the vaginal slit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_90" src="images/fig_90.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 90.</span>&mdash;Pessaries for retroversion: <small>A</small>, Hodge pessary; <small>B</small>, Smith pessary;
<small>C</small>, Thomas pessary.</p></div>

<p><a href="#fig_91">Fig. 91</a> shows a side view of a pessary in position, and
it will be observed that the curves of the instrument are
closely adapted to the curves of the posterior vaginal
wall, upon which it lies.</p>

<p>The vaginal pessary retains the uterus in place by
raising the posterior vaginal fornix and keeping tense
the posterior vaginal wall. It will be observed that the
posterior wall of the vagina runs over the upper transverse
bar of the pessary like a rope over a pulley;
therefore there is maintained a continuous traction in
an upward and backward direction upon the cervix, and
a resulting continuous tendency to throw the fundus uteri
in a forward position (<a href="#fig_91">Fig. 91</a>). The tension of the posterior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
vaginal wall and the traction upon the cervix vary
with the position and occupation of the woman, and are
increased by anything that increases the intra-abdominal
pressure.</p>

<p>The vaginal pessary does not maintain the uterus in
place by pressure upon the body of the uterus, nor does
the vaginal pessary correct a retrodisplacement. The
uterus should be restored to its normal position as nearly
as possible before the pessary is introduced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_91" src="images/fig_91.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span>&mdash;The retroversion pessary in position. The arrow shows the direction
of the traction of the posterior vaginal wall upon the cervix.</p></div>

<p>Replacement of the uterus may be effected in one of
two ways: by bimanual reposition while the woman is
in the dorsal position; or by instrumental reposition
while the woman is in the knee-chest position.</p>

<p>In bimanual reposition the uterus is manipulated between
the vaginal finger or fingers and the abdominal
hand until the organ is brought to its normal position
of anteversion (<a href="#fig_92">Fig. 92</a>). Sometimes this may be more
easily accomplished by introducing one or two fingers
into the rectum.</p>

<p>After bimanual reposition the pessary should be introduced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
in the vagina, and the upper bar of the instrument
should be carried behind the cervix by manipulation with
the vaginal finger.</p>

<p>Bimanual reposition is often difficult or impossible in
fat women and in those with rigid abdominal walls.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_92" src="images/fig_92.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.</span>&mdash;Bimanual reposition of the retroflexed uterus.</p></div>

<p>Instrumental reposition in the knee-chest position,
however, is applicable to all cases in which a pessary is
indicated. As this method is the one that should in
general be followed, it will be described in detail.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_93" src="images/fig_93.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span>&mdash;Uterine repositor.</p></div>

<p>The woman should be placed in the knee-chest position.
The perineum should be retracted and the cervix
exposed with a Sims speculum. It will be observed that
the cervix is directed forward toward the symphysis
pubis. The uterine repositor (<a href="#fig_93">Fig. 93</a>) is then introduced,
and pressure is made in the posterior vaginal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
fornix upon the displaced fundus. The fundus may be
felt with the repositor in this position. Sometimes, by
grasping the cervix with a tenaculum and drawing it
downward, the repositor may be applied with better
effect (<a href="#fig_94">Fig. 94</a>). It will often be observed that under this
pressure the fundus immediately drops forward, while the
cervix is turned backward through an angle of 90° or perhaps
180°, so that the external os looks no longer toward
the symphysis pubis, but toward the hollow of the sacrum.
The direction of the cervix shows plainly when the
uterus is in the normal position. Instead of the uterine
repositor we may use a small firm ball of cotton held in
long forceps.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_94" src="images/fig_94.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94.</span>&mdash;Replacement of retrodisplaced uterus by means of the uterine repositor,
with patient in the knee-chest position (Baldy).</p></div>

<p>Sometimes it is not possible to make the entire correction
of the displacement at one time. The uterus may
perhaps be reduced from retroversion of the third degree
to that of the first degree, and at a subsequent attempt it
may be reduced still more, until finally it is brought to
its normal position. In some cases the difficulty of producing
complete reduction at one time is due to the fact
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
that the woman is unaccustomed to the position and the
manipulations, and is constantly straining and involuntarily
resisting. Complete relaxation of the abdominal
walls is necessary.</p>

<p>If the uterus can be reduced to the normal position,
the pessary may be immediately introduced. If the reduction
is not complete, it is best to
pack the vagina with cotton to
maintain the degree of reduction
that has been attained, and to repeat
the attempt the next day, continuing
in this way until the uterus has been
brought approximately to its normal
position, when the pessary should be
introduced. The cotton should be
packed into the vagina in the form
of balls or pledgets about one and a
half inches in diameter, which should
be introduced with the forceps (<a href="#fig_95">Fig.
95</a>) and carefully and tightly packed
into the posterior vaginal fornix.
Other pieces should then be packed
against the anterior aspect of the
cervix, and then the rest of the vagina
should be rather loosely filled.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_95" src="images/fig_95.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span>&mdash;Uterine forceps.</p></div>

<p>The pessary should be introduced
with the woman in the knee-chest
position. A number of pessaries, of
various sizes and shapes, should be
at hand, in order to have a suitable
assortment for choice. The pessary
must be of the proper length, breadth,
and shape; these requirements differ in various cases.
The length of the pessary should be such that when the
upper transverse bar lies in the posterior vaginal fornix
the lower transverse bar is over the position of the internal
urinary meatus. The course of the urethra is
marked by small transverse folds of mucous membrane
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
on the middle of the anterior vaginal wall, and the internal
urinary meatus is situated approximately where
these small transverse folds cease and become merged
into the larger oblique folds of the vaginal walls. This
distance may be measured upon the uterine repositor or
it may be estimated with the eye.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that all the dimensions of the
vagina are exaggerated in the knee-chest position, as the
vaginal canal is distended by atmospheric pressure. The
width of the pessary should be such that there is no
lateral tension put upon the vaginal walls.</p>

<p>The curvature of the pessary should be such that the
upper transverse bar does not press upon the posterior
aspect of the cervix, but is so placed that the posterior
vaginal fornix is drawn upward and backward.</p>

<p>The curvature of the pessary may be altered to suit
any case by dipping the instrument in oil and gently
heating it over the flame of a spirit-lamp. In this way
the rubber is softened and may be pressed into any shape.
While soft and under pressure it should be plunged into
cold water to set it in the altered form.</p>

<p>The pessary may be introduced while the perineum is
retracted with the speculum; or it may be passed into
the vagina first, the speculum then being introduced and
the pessary moved into the proper position. The pessary
should be greased, the lower transverse bar should be
grasped with the thumb and the index finger, and the
instrument should be introduced in such a direction that
one lateral bar lies in the vaginal sulcus. The upper
transverse bar may readily be placed behind the cervix,
by manipulation with the finger or the forceps, when the
perineum is retracted with the speculum.</p>

<p>The speculum should be removed, and the woman
should assume the Sims posture for a few minutes. She
may then get up from the table, and the examination
may be made in the erect posture, for in this position,
better than in any other, the fit and the action of the
pessary may be determined. It will be found that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
lower bar of the pessary is in relation with the anterior
vaginal wall at the position of the internal urinary
meatus. It should not protrude from the ostium vaginæ.
It should be possible to pass the finger readily
between the vaginal walls and the lateral and lower
bars of the pessary. The cervix should be felt directed
backward through the upper portion of the ring of the
pessary. It will be felt that the pessary is retained in
the vagina not by any pressure against the vaginal walls,
but by a suction&mdash;in other words, by the retentive power
of the abdomen.</p>

<p>A vaginal douche of warm water should be administered
once a day while the pessary is worn.</p>

<p>The woman should be directed to return for examination
three days after the introduction of the pessary, or
sooner if any discomfort is experienced. Sometimes the
uterus becomes retroverted while the pessary is in position,
and becomes flexed over the upper bar of the instrument,
considerable pain resulting. In other cases, where
the vagina is patulous and too small an instrument is
used, the pessary becomes turned so that the long axis lies
transversely. It is well to advise the woman to remove the
instrument herself if it makes her very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The pessary should be examined digitally in the dorsal
or the erect position, or visually in the knee-chest position.
If it is found that the retroversion has returned,
the uterus should be replaced and a pessary better suited
in size and shape should be introduced. It is always
desirable to use as small an instrument as practicable.
The intervals between examinations may be gradually
lengthened to two weeks or a month. A woman using
a pessary should always be under the supervision of a
physician. The retroversion pessary does not interfere
with sexual connection.</p>

<p>The bowels should be carefully regulated. The clothing
should be supported from the shoulders, not from the
waist, and heavy lifting should be avoided as much as
possible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>After a woman has worn a pessary for three or four
months, and it is found that the uterus remains in the
normal position, the instrument should be removed and
the result carefully watched.</p>

<p>If the uterus continues in its normal position of anteversion,
a cure has been accomplished and the pessary
may be discarded. If the retroversion returns, as it very
often does, the pessary should be introduced again, and
an unfavorable prognosis of cure by this means should be
made. The patient must then choose between the use of
the pessary for an indefinite period, under medical supervision,
and cure by means of an operation.</p>

<p>The Smith pessary is better adapted to the shape of
the vagina, which normally narrows from above downward,
than is the Hodge instrument. The Thomas pessary,
in which the upper bar is made very broad, is applicable
to cases of sharp retroflexion with retroversion, in
which the upper bar may become fixed in the angle of
flexion in case the retroversion returns. The upper bar
is made so broad that the angle of flexion would be
spanned by it in case of such an accident.</p>

<p>The action of the pessary depends upon the integrity
of the vagina and the pelvic floor. The retroversion
pessary, therefore, cannot be used when there is a laceration
of the perineum. In such a case the perineum must
always be closed as a preliminary step.</p>

<p>The pessary should not be used when there is a laceration
of the cervix uteri, for traction upon the posterior
lip of the cervix increases the eversion.</p>

<p>The pessary is contraindicated in all cases in which
there are pelvic adhesions restraining the uterus, in those
cases in which there is inflammatory disease of the Fallopian
tubes, and in cases where there is prolapse of the
ovary, which may be pressed upon by the upper bar of
the pessary.</p>

<p>Before making any attempt to replace a displaced
uterus the physician should always make a careful bimanual
examination to determine the existence of any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
acute or chronic inflammation of the Fallopian tubes or
the ovaries. Such inflammation is a contraindication to
the use of the pessary and to any of the manipulations
for replacement of the uterus that have already been
described.</p>

<p>If the uterus is adherent, the pessary should not be
used. Cure of the retroversion by it is practically impossible,
and operative treatment is safer and more certain.</p>

<p><b>Operative Means of Treating Retrodisplacement
of the Uterus.</b>&mdash;A great many kinds of operation have
been introduced for curing retrodisplacement of the uterus.
The fundus has been attached to the anterior abdominal
wall by passing a needle and a suture into the
uterus and thrusting it through the uterine wall and the
anterior abdominal wall; the uterine cornua have been
sutured to the anterior parietes; the round ligaments
have been shortened by folding each upon itself, and fixed
in this position by suture; the round ligaments have been
drawn back through openings made in the broad ligaments
and attached by suture to each other and to the
posterior surface of the uterus; the utero-sacral ligaments
have been shortened; the uterus has been held forward
by sutures applied through the anterior vaginal fornix.</p>

<p>The two operations that have deservedly met with the
greatest favor are ventro-suspension of the uterus, in which
the abdomen is opened and the fundus is sutured directly
to the anterior abdominal wall, and Alexander’s operation,
in which the uterine displacement is corrected by
shortening the round ligaments as they emerge from the
inguinal rings. The latter operation is designed to be
extra-peritoneal. The following is the method of performing
Alexander’s operation:</p>

<p>The uterus should first be replaced as already described,
and held in position by a gauze or cotton pack. A two-inch
incision is made from the pubic spine in the direction
of the inguinal canal. The external inguinal ring
is opened without wounding the pillars. The thin layer
of fascia over the ring is divided, the fat is separated,
and the round ligament is sought with a blunt hook. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
the ligament is not found here, the canal may be opened
to the internal ring. When one ligament has been found,
it is secured with forceps and the wound is protected
while the other ligament is secured in a similar way.
The ligaments are then gently drawn out until they become
tense. If the inguinal canal has been opened, it
should be repaired by a catgut suture.</p>

<p>The ligament should be sutured to the pillars of the
ring by two or three sutures. The excess of the ligament,
sometimes amounting to two or three inches, should
be cut off. The incision should then be closed.</p>

<p>The field of this operation is very limited. It is not
applicable when there are adhesions nor when there is
disease of the tubes or ovaries requiring operative treatment.</p>

<p>Many of the cases of retroversion of the uterus that
require operative treatment are complicated by salpingitis
and pelvic adhesions, though these extra-uterine
conditions are very often not recognized by bimanual
examination before the abdomen is opened.</p>

<p>The operation that at present seems to possess most
advantages for the cure of those cases of retroversion of
the uterus that cannot be cured by the pessary is the
operation of ventro-suspension of the uterus (<a href="#fig_96">Fig. 96</a>).
It is performed as follows:</p>

<p>An incision, one and a half to three inches in length,
is made in the median line of the anterior abdominal
wall, immediately above the pubis. Two fingers are
introduced into the abdominal cavity, and the fundus
uteri is lifted forward. The plane of the abdominal
incision is exposed, and a curved needle carrying a medium-sized
silk suture is passed through a few fibers of the
rectus muscle and the peritoneum on one side, immediately
above the lower angle of the incision. The needle
is then passed through the tissue of the fundus uteri on
the line joining the uterine cornua or a little posterior to
this line. The amount of uterine tissue included in the
suture is about one-quarter of an inch broad and one-eighth
to one-quarter of an inch deep. The needle is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
then passed through the peritoneum and a few fibers of
the rectus muscle on the side of the abdominal incision
opposite the point of entrance. The fascia of the rectus
should not be included. A similar suture is passed
about one-third of an inch above this, traversing the
uterine wall on a line about one-third of an inch posterior
to the first suture. While the fundus is held forward
by the finger of an assistant these sutures are tied, so
that the fundus uteri is brought into contact with the
anterior abdominal wall. The ends of the sutures are
cut short. The abdominal incision is then closed by
three layers of sutures&mdash;silk for the peritoneum, catgut
for the muscle and fascia, and the intra-cutaneous suture
for the skin. Accompanying disease of the tubes and
ovaries may be treated directly by this operation, and any
adhesions may readily be broken.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_96" src="images/fig_96.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 96.</span>&mdash;Position of the sutures in ventro-suspension of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>In performing this operation it should be remembered
that we do not wish to make a fixation of the uterus to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
the anterior abdominal wall. The inclusion of a broad
mass of uterine tissue in the suture, and scarification of
the anterior face of the uterus, which is sometimes practised,
may result in a broad, unyielding adhesion which
will interfere with the normal mobility of the uterus and
with the course of pregnancy and labor.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_97" src="images/fig_97.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span>&mdash;The suspensory ligament two years after the operation of ventro-suspension.
The ligament measured three inches in length.</p></div>

<p>After this operation of ventro-suspension the fundus
uteri does not remain permanently in contact with the
anterior abdominal wall. In time it drops somewhat
backward and downward. The silk sutures drag out a
ribbon-shaped fold of tissue consisting of peritoneum and
a little muscle-fiber from the anterior abdominal wall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
and a similar fold of peritoneum and perhaps some muscular
fibers from the uterus, so that in time the uterus
becomes attached by a slight pliable ligament from one
to three inches in length (<a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>). Bimanual examination
of the uterus one year after this operation shows
that the uterus has about the normal range of mobility.
If this operation is properly performed, the course of subsequent
pregnancies and labors seems to be in no way impeded.</p>

<p>The operation of ventro-suspension should always be
accompanied by perineorrhaphy in case there has been
laceration of the perineum. The two operations may
be done at the same time.</p>

<p>The treatment of retrodisplacement of the uterus may
be briefly summarized as follows:</p>

<p>The cases of retrodisplacement of the uterus suitable
for treatment by the pessary are those in which there are
no adhesions and in which there is no disease of the Fallopian
tubes or the ovaries. If a prolapsed ovary returns
to its normal position when the displacement of the uterus
is corrected, it will of course not be pressed upon by the
bar of the pessary. But in some cases the ovarian prolapse
continues even though the uterus is in its normal
position, and under such circumstances a pessary usually
cannot be tolerated.</p>

<p>The cases that offer the best prospect of cure by the
pessary are those cases of retroversion, occurring as the
result of labor, in which the perineum is intact, and
which are seen within one or two years after the occurrence
of the lesion. The prognosis becomes more unfavorable
the longer the condition has existed before
treatment.</p>

<p>Cases of congenital retroversion, or those occurring in
young unmarried women, are very difficult to cure with
the pessary. This instrument should always be tried for
a few months, however, before operative measures are
advised. In such cases the uterus has been so long in an
abnormal position that its natural supports have become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
permanently altered, and some continuous additional aid
is necessary to maintain the normal position.</p>

<p>Every woman who uses a pessary should be under the
supervision of a physician, and for this reason it is often
most advisable to recommend immediate operation to
poor women as the quickest and surest method of cure.</p>

<p>Immediate operation should always be advised in all
cases of retroversion with adhesion or with disease of
the tubes and ovaries.</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten that we occasionally see
women with retroversion of the uterus who present no
symptoms whatever referable to this lesion. In such
cases no treatment is required.</p>

<p>Of the 20 women who became pregnant and went to full term, the course
of pregnancy was normal, and the children were all born alive. One woman
had a prolonged and difficult labor, though forceps were not used. In 1 case
forceps were used to deliver a ten-pound child, who presented in occipito-posterior
position; in the remaining 18 cases labor was normal.</p>

<p>The operation of ventro-suspension seems to have had nothing whatever to do
with producing the miscarriages. In fact, the number of miscarriages is small
for any series of 211 women, most of whom were of the dispensary class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Since collecting the statistics in the preceding note, we have continued
to perform this operation in all cases of retroversion suitable for operation,

<h3 id="LACERATION_OF_THE_CERVIX_UTERI">LACERATION OF THE CERVIX UTERI.</h3>

<p>Laceration of the neck of the uterus is of very frequent
occurrence. It is said that nearly every woman
suffers with a laceration of greater or less extent at her
first labor. The majority of such lacerations, however,
undoubtedly heal during the puerperium and give no
subsequent trouble. The lacerations that concern the
gynecologist are those that persist, remaining ununited
after the woman leaves her bed. The description of the
injured parts and the treatment therefor will be applicable
to such old cases of laceration. It is true that some
gynecologists have advised immediate examination and
the primary operation for repair in case of laceration of
the cervix, as in case of injury to the perineum; but such
a course has at present but little endorsement. It is difficult
to obtain a satisfactory examination under such
circumstances. A digital examination alone, unless the
sense of touch be very acute, would often fail to detect
the lesion in the soft cervical tissue. The woman is
exposed to the danger of infection of the upper genital
tract from the manipulations of the examination and the
operation, and such exposure may be unnecessary, because
there is no doubt that many lacerations of the
cervix unite of themselves.</p>

<p>It has been found necessary to perform the operation
immediately after labor on account of severe hemorrhage
from the lacerated wound.</p>

<p>Laceration of the cervix may take place in any direction,
and the injury is described according to the direction
and number of the tears. A lateral laceration takes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
place on either side of the cervix. A bilateral laceration
involves both sides (<a href="#fig_104">Fig. 104</a>, <i><small>A</small></i>). The left is the more
usual lateral laceration (<a href="#fig_98">Fig. 98</a>), and in case of a bilateral
tear the injury on the left side is usually the more extensive.
The stellate laceration (<a href="#fig_99">Fig. 99</a>) occurs when three
or more lacerations radiate from the cervical canal. The
less common varieties of laceration seen by the gynecologist
are through the anterior and through the posterior
lip. It may be that such lacerations occur as often as
the lateral lacerations, and that spontaneous repair more
often occurs, so that they produce no subsequent trouble.
The relations of the neck of the uterus are such that
accurate apposition of the injured parts is more likely to
occur in case of antero-posterior laceration than in the
lateral form of the injury. In some cases there seems to
be no doubt that the laceration has extended through the
posterior lip of the cervix into the cellular tissue above
the posterior vaginal fornix, and that spontaneous repair
has taken place, leaving a dense band of scar-tissue to
mark the site of the lesion.</p>

<p>An incomplete laceration of the cervix is sometimes
found. In this injury the tear has extended but part way
through the wall of the cervix. The mucous membrane
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
of the cervical canal and the muscular wall of the cervix
are lacerated, but the injury does not involve the mucous
membrane of the vaginal aspect, beyond, perhaps, a slight
splitting of the external os (<a href="#fig_100">Fig. 100</a>). The lesion is thus
concealed, and separation of the portions of the cervix is
prevented. The injury may be detected by introducing
a sound in the cervical canal and placing a finger on the
vaginal aspect of the cervix, when it will be found that
at this spot the point of the sound and the finger are
separated only by the thickness of the vaginal mucous
membrane, and not by the normal thickness of the wall
of the cervix.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_100" src="images/fig_100.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.</span>&mdash;Incomplete laceration of the cervix.</p></div>

<p>The appearance of a lacerated cervix varies with the
time that has elapsed since the receipt of the injury. A
few weeks or months after the occurrence the torn portions
of the cervix will be found, by sight or touch, lying
in more or less close apposition, the general conical
shape of the cervix being unaltered. After the lapse of
a longer period, however, the edges of the laceration become
rounded, and a certain amount of eversion, or turning
out, of the portions of the cervix takes place, so that
the mucous membrane of the cervical canal becomes exposed.
This eversion is always most pronounced in the
bilateral laceration, and is especially striking when the
tear has extended entirely through the cervix into the lateral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
vaginal fornices. In such cases the cervix assumes the
shape of a split stalk of celery (<a href="#fig_101">Fig. 101</a>). The cases of
laceration with eversion of the lips are those in which
the most marked symptoms are found. When eversion
occurs, and the mucous membrane of the cervical canal is
exposed, the shape and appearance
of the cervix are
very much altered from the
normal. Before the true nature
of this lesion had been
pointed out by Emmet such
a cervix was said to be ulcerated,
the raw-looking surface,
corresponding to the exposed,
irritated, and inflamed
mucous membrane of the cervical
canal, having been mistaken
for an ulcer. Even at
the present day such a mistake
is not infrequently
made.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_101" src="images/fig_101.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 101.</span>-Bilateral laceration of
the cervix with eversion. The dotted
line shows the normal shape of
the cervix.</p></div>

<p>Microscopical examination
of such raw-looking surfaces
shows that they are in no
sense ulcers. “The surface
is covered with a single layer of epithelium; the cells
are smaller than those which line the normal cervical
canal, and, being narrow and long, have a palisade-like
arrangement; the thin layer of cells allows the subjacent
vascular tissue to shine through, hence the redness of
color. The surface is further thrown into numerous
folds, producing glandular recesses and processes; these
processes cause the granular appearance of the surface”
(Hart and Barbour).</p>

<p>These red patches are larger than the surface of the
everted mucous membrane of the cervical canal; they are
continuous with, but extend beyond the limits of, this
mucous membrane. It is said that this increase is occasioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
by proliferation of the epithelium that lines the
cervical glands.</p>

<p>As a substitute for the misleading term “ulceration,”
applied to this condition, there have been proposed the
terms “erosion,” “ectropion,” or “eversion” of the
mucous membrane, and “catarrhal patch.”</p>

<p>A true ulcerated surface is sometimes found on a lacerated
cervix as a result of excessive irritation, but such a
condition is rare.</p>

<p>As the laceration occurs in the cervix before involution
has begun, this process is impeded, so that a state
of subinvolution of the cervix results, and the part remains
hypertrophied or much larger than normal.</p>

<p>The cervical glands share in this condition of subinvolution,
retaining much of the increased size and activity
that are normal in the pregnant state.</p>

<p>Changes due to chronic congestion and inflammation
also take place. The connective tissue increases in
amount, and the cervix becomes hard, indurated, or
sclerotic.</p>

<p>The racemose glands, which open upon the cervical
mucous membrane, become inflamed, and, as a result of
change in the consistency of the glandular secretion
or of obstruction of the gland-orifices, retention takes
place, with the production of small cysts called Nabothian
cysts. Such cysts often extend peripherally, so that the
distal end of the occluded gland approaches the vaginal
aspect of the cervix, and appears beneath the mucous
membrane as a translucent vesicle about the size of a
small pea. Puncture of such a vesicle permits the escape
of a drop of gelatinous fluid.</p>

<p>The whole of the body of the cervix may be filled with
innumerable cysts of this kind, of varying size. When
projecting beneath the mucous membrane they feel like
small shot imbedded in the cervix. A cervix in this
condition is said to have undergone cystic degeneration.
The inflammation of the lower exposed portion of the
mucous membrane of the cervical canal extends upward,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
so that a condition of general chronic cervical catarrh
results. This exceedingly common disease is usually
caused by laceration of the cervix.</p>

<p>The focus of continuous irritation in the cervix interferes
with the normal involution of the body of the
uterus, so that there occurs a condition of uterine subinvolution,
which may be the cause of the chief symptoms
with which the woman suffers. The endometrium shares
in the subinvolution, and, as a consequence of this, and
perhaps also from extension of inflammation from the
cervical mucous membrane, various forms of endometritis
may occur.</p>

<p>In some cases of laceration of the cervix no groove
corresponding to the angle of the laceration can be felt
or seen, because it has been filled with a plug or mass of
cicatricial tissue. In such cases this plug of scar-tissue
may be felt, distinguished by the palpating finger from
the softer surrounding tissues of the cervix.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;The symptoms of laceration of the cervix
uteri are usually referable to pathological conditions
that are secondary to the laceration, and are in no way
characteristic. Leucorrhea, or a discharge from the exposed
and inflamed cervical mucous membrane, is usually
present. Menstruation is often irregular, and is increased
in duration and amount as a result of the subinvolution
of the uterus and the chronic congestion, and perhaps
inflammation, of the endometrium. Backache and vertical
headache may also be present from the same cause.</p>

<p>If the tear is at all extensive&mdash;and especially if it extends
through the cervix into the cellular tissue of the
broad ligament&mdash;pelvic pain, referred to the general position
of the scar, may be experienced.</p>

<p>Movement of the cervix or of the uterus that causes traction
upon the scar in the broad ligament produces pain.
Such pain may result from the bimanual examination,
from jarring or movements of the body, from defecation,
or from coitus.</p>

<p>Much of the pelvic pain with which women suffer in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
laceration of the cervix is probably due to the pelvic
lymphangitis and lymphadenitis that are caused by the
continuous irritation of the diseased cervix.</p>

<p>Sterility is a not unusual accompaniment of laceration
of the cervix. It may be due to the malposition of the
external os or to the profuse cervical discharges. In case
conception occurs, abortion may follow on account of
the pathological condition of the body of the uterus and
of the endometrium.</p>

<p>Sometimes very marked reflex nervous disturbances are
caused by a laceration of the cervix. Such disturbances
are most pronounced in those cases in which there is
much cicatricial tissue, and in those in which the cervix
is hard and sclerotic or cystic as a result of long-standing
inflammation&mdash;in other words, in those cases in which
the substance of the cervix is most affected.</p>

<p>Neuralgia may occur in any part of the body. It is
usually situated in the pelvis, or it may extend to the
groin and down the thigh. Reflex nausea and vomiting
may result from this as from other lesions of the uterus.
Cataleptic convulsions and neurasthenia may also result
from an old laceration of the cervix. The pelvic focus
of irritation is constantly wearing and exhausting nervous
energy.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis.</b>&mdash;The diagnosis of laceration of the cervix
is readily made by digital examination. The palpating
finger feels the one or more angles of laceration. The
cervix loses its normal dome-like shape and becomes
broader and flatter. In those cases of bilateral laceration
where the eversion of the lips of the cervix is so marked
that the angles of laceration are obliterated&mdash;becoming,
in fact, 180 degrees&mdash;or where the angles have become
filled up by a plug of cicatricial tissue, the angles of
the laceration, of course, cannot be felt. We may often,
however, detect the presence of the plug of cicatricial
tissue, which feels harder than the surrounding tissues
of the cervix; and we can always determine the presence
of the eversion which seems to have obscured the lesion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
As the finger is passed over the flattened presenting
cervix it is found that the shape is not round, but oval,
with the long axis antero-posterior. The finger passes
around a corner or edge as it glides into the anterior or
posterior vaginal fornix. This corner or edge is the
extremity of the torn everted lip of the cervix. It corresponds
approximately with the margin of the normal
external os. The apparent external os, or the opening
of the cervical canal, which occupies the center of the
presenting cervix, is really a part of the cervical canal
higher up than the normal os&mdash;a part of the canal that
has been exposed by the laceration and separation of the
lips. This fact should be remembered when the length of
the uterus is measured by the sound. The measurement
taken from the apparent external os is often half an inch,
or even one inch, less than it would be if the cervix were
restored. The degree of subinvolution of the uterus
indicated by the measurement of the length is often,
therefore, considerably greater than would be supposed
after such imperfect measurement.</p>

<p>The presence of an erosion on the face of the cervix
may also be determined by palpation. The eroded surface
has a soft and somewhat velvety feeling, in contrast
with the smooth surface of the normal vaginal cervix
covered with squamous epithelium.</p>

<p>The cystic degeneration is readily detected by feeling
the small shot-like cysts that cover the cervix; and the
sclerotic condition is indicated by the increased hardness
or induration, which is easily perceptible to the finger.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory visual examination of a lacerated
cervix is made through the Sims speculum, with the
woman in the Sims or the genu-pectoral position. The
bivalve speculum, by separating the upper vaginal walls,
often increases the eversion of the lips and masks the
lesion.</p>

<p>The nature of the injury in cases of bilateral laceration
with eversion may readily be proved in examining
through the Sims speculum. If the anterior and posterior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
lips of the cervix be seized with tenacula and then
drawn together, it will be observed that the area of
erosion disappears and the normal shape of the cervix is
approximately restored.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;All forms of laceration of the cervix in
which there exist eversion, erosion, cystic degeneration,
and sclerosis should be operated upon. A slight laceration
in a young woman in the active childbearing period does
not demand operative treatment if there are no symptoms
referable to the laceration. In women approaching middle
life (forty years of age) all lacerations of the cervix
should be closed, whether or not they produce symptoms.</p>

<p>It should always be remembered that cancer is most
likely to originate in a cervix that has been lacerated,
and the woman should be protected against this danger.</p>

<p>The treatment of laceration of the cervix is operative.
A definite mechanical injury has been inflicted, and the
parts must be repaired by operation.</p>

<p>The operation for the repair of a lacerated cervix is
called trachelorrhaphy. The operation consists in denuding
or excising the tissues on the torn surfaces and bringing
the freshened surfaces together with sutures.</p>

<p>The form of the operation for a bilateral laceration is
shown in <a href="#fig_104">Fig. 104</a>. The operation should preferably be
performed immediately after a menstrual period.</p>

<p>The instruments necessary for the operation of trachelorrhaphy
are two double tenacula, two single
tenacula, tissue-forceps, needle-holder,
shot-compressor, Sims’ speculum, needles,
(<a href="#fig_102">Fig. 102</a>), knife, and scissors, sharp-pointed
and curved on the flat (<a href="#fig_103">Fig. 103</a>). The
needles should be spear-pointed and should
be strong and sharp, as the cervical tissues
through which they are passed are
often very dense. The straight or the
curved needle may be used.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_102" src="images/fig_102.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 102.</span>&mdash;Cervix-needles.</p></div>

<p>Silkworm gut, shotted, is an exceedingly good suture-material.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>The woman should be placed either in the Sims or the
dorso-sacral position. The vulva, vagina, and cervix
should be thoroughly cleansed and rendered as aseptic as
possible. The cervix should be exposed through the
Sims speculum. The anterior and, if desirable, the posterior
lip of the cervix should be seized with a double
tenaculum and held by an assistant; or the lip may be
transfixed by a silk ligature, with which the cervix may
be held.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_103" src="images/fig_103.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 103.</span>&mdash;Curved scissors for performing trachelorrhaphy.</p></div>

<p>The denudation, which may be made with a knife or
with scissors curved on the flat, should be begun upon the
lower lip. The tissue to be removed may first be marked
out with the knife. The tissue to either side of the old
external os is seized with a tenaculum or with toothed
tissue-forceps, and a strip is elevated by an incision
extending into the angle of the tear. A corresponding
opposite portion of tissue on the anterior lip is then
seized in a similar manner, and a similar strip of tissue
is excised, meeting and joining the strip first raised
in the angle of the tear. We thus remove a wedge-shaped
portion of tissue. The operation is then repeated
upon the other side. The strip of mucous membrane
that is left on the center of the lips to form the new
cervical canal should be about a quarter of an inch in
width.</p>

<p>If the finger be passed over the freshened surfaces,
small indurated masses of tissue are sometimes felt.
Such tissue should be caught with the tenaculum or the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
forceps and excised. This condition is most usual when
the tear has been of long standing and the cervix has
undergone sclerotic changes. It is important that the
excision of tissue should be carried well up in the angle
of the laceration, in order that all hard cicatricial tissue
may be excised.</p>

<p>The excision of tissue should be done as nearly as possible
in the plane of the laceration. A frequent mistake
is to remove too much tissue from the vaginal aspect of
the cervix.</p>

<p>There is usually but little bleeding in the operation of
trachelorrhaphy, and whatever bleeding there is may
always be controlled by properly placed sutures.</p>

<p>The first suture should embrace the angle of the laceration.
It should be introduced on the vaginal aspect of
the cervix, near the edge of the mucous membrane, and
should emerge on the edge of the mucous membrane of
the cervical canal. It should then be reintroduced at a
corresponding point on the opposite lip, and should
emerge on the mucous membrane of the vaginal aspect.
It is often difficult to bring the first suture out on the
mucous membrane of the cervical canal. This, however,
is not necessary if the suture embraces the whole of the
denuded angle.</p>

<p>The other sutures, usually two or three in number, are
introduced in a similar manner near the edge of the
mucous membrane of the vaginal aspect, pass around
the whole of the denuded surface, and emerge on the
mucous membrane of the cervical canal, near the edge.
They are then re-introduced on the opposite lip, and
emerge at a corresponding point on the vaginal aspect of
this lip.</p>

<p>A frequent mistake is to bring the sutures out on the
raw surface so that the lateral union of the torn lips is
shallow and superficial, often consisting only of the thickness
of the mucous membrane of the vaginal aspect of
the cervix. As the result of such an operation the new-formed
cervical canal is spindle-shaped, much broader
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
than normal, and the condition of an incomplete laceration
of the cervix results.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

has been marked out with the knife; <i>C</i>, the denudation has been accomplished;
<i>D</i>, sutures introduced; <i>E</i>, completed operation.</p></div>

<p>After the operation the vagina should be washed out
with a 1:2000 solution of bichloride; it should then be
dried with sponge or gauze, and a light vaginal pack
of sterile gauze should be introduced.</p>

<p>The gauze pack should be removed at the end of forty-eight
hours, and after this a daily douche, with subsequent
drying of the vagina, should be administered.
The woman should remain in bed for two weeks. There
is always present some subinvolution of the uterus, which
is much benefited by rest in the recumbent position.</p>

<p>The sutures may be removed at any time after two
weeks. To do this the woman should be placed in the
lithotomy position. The perineum should be retracted
with a Sims speculum, and the anterior vaginal wall
should be supported by an elevator in the hand of an assistant.</p>

<p>If a perineorrhaphy is necessary, it should be performed
at the same time as the trachelorrhaphy. In this case the
cervix sutures should not be removed for three or four
weeks, in order to avoid pressure upon the perineum by
the retracting speculum.</p>

<p>If there is present marked subinvolution of the uterus
with accompanying endometritis, the cervical canal
should be slightly dilated and the body of the uterus
should be thoroughly curetted immediately before performing
the trachelorrhaphy.</p>

<p>If the operation of trachelorrhaphy is performed within
a few months after the receipt of the laceration&mdash;before
sclerotic, cystic, and erosion changes have appeared&mdash;there
is usually required but little preparatory treatment.
When, however, there is a marked and widespread erosion,
and the cervix is full of numerous Nabothian cysts, or is
hard and sclerotic from inflammatory exudate, it is necessary
to devote from two to six weeks to preparation of
the cervix for operation. Many failures in the operation
of trachelorrhaphy are due to neglect of such preparatory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
treatment. The hard, cystic cervix may unite but imperfectly
after operation, or the symptoms referable to
the diseased cervix may remain unrelieved by the operation.
We often see women in whom laceration of the
cervix has been closed with good union, and yet the sclerotic
cystic condition of the cervix, and perhaps subinvolution
of the uterus, persist, and symptoms continue
as pronounced as before operation.</p>

<p>The preliminary or preparatory treatment consists of
the administration of vaginal douches, regulation of the
bowels by saline purgatives, and local applications to,
and puncture of, the cervix uteri.</p>

<p>The woman should take, two or three times a day, a
vaginal douche of one gallon of hot water (110° F.).
The douche should be administered in the recumbent
posture.</p>

<p>One or two watery fecal movements should be produced
daily by Rochelle salts, sulphate
of magnesium, or some similar
preparation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_105" src="images/fig_105.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 105.</span>&mdash;Cotton tampon.</p></div>

<p>Every five or six days the woman
should be placed in the knee-chest
position and the cervix should be
exposed with the Sims speculum.
The Nabothian cysts, which appear
as translucent vesicles beneath
the mucous membrane,
should each be punctured with
a sharp knife-point. If the cervix
is much enlarged and congested,
it should be freely punctured
over the whole vaginal aspect
to produce local depletion. Half
an ounce or an ounce of blood may
be removed in this way. The cervix
should then be thoroughly
dried, and an application of Churchill’s tincture of iodine
should be made over the whole of the cervix and the vaginal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
vault. The excess of iodine should be removed with
a little cotton, and a cotton tampon (to which is attached
a string) saturated with glycerin should be placed against
the cervix (<a href="#fig_105">Fig. 105</a>). The hygroscopic action of the glycerin
is most useful in depleting the cervix. The woman
should be told to remove the tampon by traction on the
string at the end of twelve hours, and to follow the removal
with a vaginal douche of hot water.</p>

<p>Such local treatment should be instituted immediately
after a menstrual period and should be repeated every five
or six days, and continued until the erosion and the cysts
have disappeared and the induration has diminished.
Three weeks of such treatment usually produce a very
marked change. The cervix not only becomes much
more healthy in appearance, but most of the symptoms
of which the woman complained vanish. The leucorrhea
diminishes or ceases; the backache and headache disappear.
The relief is often so marked that the patient
suggests the advisability of deferring operation. This,
however, should never be countenanced, as all the symptoms
will return with cessation of treatment.</p>

<p>If, after the careful administration of the treatment
here prescribed for five or six weeks, the induration and
cystic degeneration do not disappear, then the case is not
one that will be benefited by trachelorrhaphy. The mere
closure or union of the indurated and cystic lips of the
cervix will not cure the woman if these conditions persist.</p>

<p>If the inflammatory changes secondary to the laceration
have become so deeply seated that they are not relieved
by the preparatory treatment, amputation of the cervix
is necessary. In any doubtful case, therefore, this preparatory
treatment is to a certain extent indicative of the
character of the ultimate operation to be performed.</p>

<p>The description of the operation already given is
applicable to the most usual form of laceration&mdash;a bilateral
laceration. If the injury be unilateral, it may be
necessary to split the cervix on the sound side in order to
denude, and to introduce sutures, on the injured side. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
case may then be repaired as in the bilateral form of
injury. In the case of the unusual stellate laceration the
lacerations must be separately repaired, or two lacerations
may be converted into one by excision of the intervening
tissue.</p>

<p>The incomplete laceration may be recognized in the
manner already described, by introducing a sound into
the cervical canal and a finger in the vaginal fornix.
Such an injury should be treated by splitting up the
cervix and converting the incomplete into a complete
tear, and then denuding where necessary and closing as
in the case of an open laceration.</p>

<p>If, in an old laceration, the sclerotic and cystic condition
of the cervix does not
yield to the preparatory treatment
advised, amputation of
the cervix is necessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 106.</span>&mdash;An old incomplete
laceration of the cervix with hypertrophy
and cystic degeneration. Amputation
is necessary.</p></div>

<p><i>Amputation of the Cervix.</i>&mdash;This
operation is performed
as follows: The cervix
is split bilaterally to the
vaginal junction with knife
or scissors. Two flaps are
formed in this way, and each
flap is then amputated separately,
the posterior one first
(Figs. 107-109). An incision
is made on the vaginal aspect
of the posterior flap, extending
from the angle of the
split on one side to the angle
of that on the other. The
knife is thrust deeply into
the cervical tissue and is
directed toward the cervical
canal. An incision is then made across the mucous membrane
of the cervical canal, on the anterior aspect of this
flap. The posterior lip is thus removed. The anterior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
lip is removed in a similar manner. The stump of the
cervix is then closed by sutures. Two or three sutures
are introduced on each side of the cervix to close the
angles, just as in the operation of trachelorrhaphy for a
bilateral tear, and two sutures are introduced on each flap
to attach the mucous membrane of the cervical canal to
the mucous membrane of the vaginal aspect, to form the
new external os. The first sutures should be passed well
up in the angles at the lateral vaginal fornices, to control
bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to be free in this operation
than in a simple trachelorrhaphy, but it may always
be controlled by the proper application of the first
sutures placed in the angles.</p>

<p>The post-operative treatment is similar to that after the

<p>Amputation of the cervix does not interfere with conception,
with the course of pregnancy, or with labor.

<h3 id="INFLAMMATION_OF_THE_CERVICAL_MUCOUS_MEMBRANE_CERVICAL_CATARRH">INFLAMMATION OF THE CERVICAL MUCOUS MEMBRANE (CERVICAL CATARRH).</h3>

<p>The mucous membrane of the cervical canal may be
the seat of acute or chronic inflammation. Acute inflammation
usually occurs as part of a general acute process
affecting the whole of the endometrium, and is commonly
the result of gonorrheal or septic infection. It
will be considered under General Endometritis.</p>

<p>Chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
cervical canal (cervical catarrh or cervical endometritis)
is an exceedingly common affection. Unless caused by
gonorrhea, it is nearly always secondary to some local or
general condition.</p>

<p>The pathological changes that take place in the mucous
membrane resemble those found in a similar process
in other parts of the body. There is a very marked
congestion and hypersecretion of the racemose glands
of the cervical canal, so that the most prominent symptom
of cervical catarrh, a profuse cervical leucorrhea, is
produced. This discharge resembles the normal secretion
of the cervical glands. In its physical properties it
is characteristic. It is a thick, tenacious mucus, and
differs decidedly from the thin, more serous discharge
from the vagina or from the body of the uterus. The
discharge is often opaque; it is rarely purulent, and is
very rarely streaked with blood. The mucous membrane
of the cervical canal becomes swollen, and may project or
prolapse beyond the limits of the external os, so that the
external os has around it a ring of red congested mucous
membrane. A similar condition is observed on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
eyelids in conjunctivitis. Such a prolapse of the mucous
membrane would bring the orifices of some of the racemose
glands upon the vaginal aspect of the cervix, where
it will be remembered they are not normally present.
The inflammatory action extends beyond the limits of the
external os on to the vaginal aspect of the cervix. The
squamous epithelium exfoliates over a limited area around
the external os, and there is produced an erosion resembling
that already described under Laceration of the Cervix.
Consequently, the red eroded area surrounding the
external os that appears in many cases of chronic inflammation
of the cervical mucous membrane is due to extension
of the inflammatory process on to the vaginal
aspect (with desquamation of the superficial squamous
cells) and to prolapse of the mucous membrane of the
cervical canal. The racemose glands may become obstructed,
either as a result of thickening in the character
of the secretion or of occlusion of the orifices, and small
retention-cysts are formed, which often fill the body of
the cervix, and, extending peripherally, appear beneath
the mucous membrane of the vaginal aspect. The cervix
is then said to have undergone cystic degeneration.
Deep-seated inflammatory changes may also take place
as a result of cervical catarrh, so that at first a slight
hypertrophy from inflammatory exudate results, and later
the formation of connective tissue produces a sclerotic
condition of the cervix.</p>

<p>As has been said, chronic cervical catarrh, unless of
gonorrheal origin, is nearly always secondary to some
local or general condition. The most usual cause of the
disease is laceration of the cervix, which causes inflammation
of the mucous membrane by direct injury and
exposure.</p>

<p>The various flexions and displacements of the uterus
are often accompanied by cervical catarrh, which probably
is caused by the chronic congestion brought about by
interference with the circulation of the body and cervix.
The use of frequent douches of cold water to prevent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
conception is said to result in chronic inflammation of
the cervical mucous membrane.</p>

<p>Imperfect involution after labor, miscarriage, or menstruation
may cause cervical catarrh from the chronic
congestion that results.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea seems in many cases to be communicated
directly and primarily to the cervical mucous membrane,
and results in a most obstinate form of chronic inflammation.</p>

<p>The scrofulous and tubercular diatheses seem undoubtedly
to predispose a woman to chronic inflammation of
the mucous membrane of the cervix, as of other mucous
membranes of the body. Cervical catarrh often appears
in such women without any local lesion to account for it.
The severity of the local trouble depends upon the general
condition, diminishing when the general health improves.</p>

<p>In all cases of cervical catarrh, even though dependent
upon a distinct local lesion like a laceration of the cervix
or a flexion of the uterus, the severity of the catarrh, as
measured by the quantity of the discharge, is very much
dependent upon the general health. The woman is often
troubled by leucorrhea only at those times at which her
general health is impaired by overwork, anxiety, or from
some other cause; and even though the disease may be
apparently cured by appropriate treatment, the symptom,
leucorrhea, is very apt to reappear whenever the woman
is subjected to such depressing influences.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous <b>symptom</b> of cervical catarrh is
the leucorrhea&mdash;the discharge from the cervical glands.
As has already been said, in its physical properties it is
characteristic. It is a thick, opaque, tenacious mucus.
The quantity is often so great that the clothes of the
woman are soiled and she is obliged to wear a napkin.</p>

<p>There may be present slight backache and a feeling of
vague discomfort or pain in the pelvis as a result of the
inflammation of the cervix. It is difficult, however, to
separate symptoms referable distinctly to the cervical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
inflammation from those due to the primary trouble, to
which the cervical inflammation is also to be attributed.
The only one distinct symptom of cervical inflammation
is the leucorrhea.</p>

<p>Digital examination in a case of cervical catarrh usually
reveals an altered condition of the cervix. The vaginal
cervix may be somewhat enlarged and soft in the early
stages of the disease, or cystic and sclerotic in the later
stages. The external os is usually enlarged, often admitting
the tip of the index finger even in those who have not
suffered with laceration of the cervix. The prolapsed
mucous membrane is present, and the erosion may be
readily felt around the external os, being easily distinguished
from the smooth, less velvety squamous mucous
membrane of the vaginal aspect.</p>

<p>Speculum examination shows a congested vaginal cervix
and a patulous external os around which is the red
erosion already described. Escaping from the external
os is seen the thick cervical mucus, which is often so
tenacious that it may be lifted from the cervical canal
with forceps.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of cervical catarrh is usually very easily
made from a consideration of the signs described. The
important thing in any case is to determine the cause of
the inflammation of the cervical mucous membrane, in
order that the proper treatment may be directed to it.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;As has been said, cervical catarrh is
always secondary to some local or general condition,
except in the case of direct gonorrheal infection. The
gonorrheal cases must be determined by the history of
the disease and by the distinctive signs of gonorrheal
infection which will be described later.</p>

<p>In every case of cervical catarrh a thorough examination
to determine the local cause of the disorder must be
made. If, as will usually be the case, such a local cause
is discovered, the treatment should be applied to it, and
the inflammation of the mucous membrane may be disregarded,
with confidence that it will disappear when the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
exciting cause is removed. Many cases are treated by
local applications, the whole attention of the physician
being wrongly directed to the secondary condition, while
the exciting lesion, such as laceration of the cervix, subinvolution,
or a flexion or version, is neglected. Such
treatment, of course, results in but temporary benefit.</p>

<p>Besides such cases of chronic local inflammation dependent
upon a distinct local lesion, there are many others
in which the catarrh is but a local manifestation of a
general state of depressed or poor health, or of a distinct
dyscrasia like tuberculosis, syphilis, or scrofula. Local
treatment in such cases, to the neglect of the general
health, is wrong.</p>

<p>If the advice here given&mdash;to seek for the primary cause
of the cervical catarrh and to cure it&mdash;is followed, it will
be found that there are but very few cases that depend
for cure upon local applications. Simple local treatment
by douches, etc. may, however, be valuable aids in
hastening the cure of the disease after the exciting cause
has been removed.</p>

<p>The treatment may be considered under two heads, the
general and the local treatment.</p>

<p>General tonic treatment is required in most cases of
protracted cervical catarrh. The preparations of iron
are the most valuable in this condition.</p>

<p>The contraindication to the use of iron in uterine disease
is menorrhagia or metrorrhagia&mdash;profuse bleeding
from the uterus. If in any case this symptom is present,
and it is found that the bleeding is increased after the
administration of iron, then this drug should be discontinued.</p>

<p>The following are useful prescriptions in those cases in
which iron is indicated:</p>

<p>Strychnine in addition to the iron is often a most useful
medicine in cervical catarrh.</p>

<p>Various medicines have been administered internally
to control the hypersecretion from the cervical glands.
Such therapeutics, however, is not to be relied upon.</p>

<p>Any distinct pathological condition, like tuberculosis
or syphilis, should, of course, receive the appropriate
treatment.</p>

<p>Local treatment may be directed to the vaginal aspect
of the cervix or directly to the cervical canal. The
former treatment should always be tried first, and it will
usually be found sufficient. It consists of the administration
of hot vaginal douches, the application of Churchill’s
tincture of iodine to the vaginal vault, and the use of the
glycerin tampon as described under the treatment of
laceration of the cervix. Puncture of the cervix in order
to produce local depletion, as already mentioned in the
preparatory treatment of laceration of the cervix, may
also be tried.</p>

<p>If any case of cervical catarrh persists after the cure
of the primary local or general lesion, in case such a
lesion is present, and after the additional local treatment
by douches and applications to the vaginal vault, then
we may be obliged to make applications directly to the
mucous membrane of the cervical canal.</p>

<p>These applications should be made as follows, any time
in the menstrual interval being appropriate: The cervix
should be exposed through the Sims or the bivalve speculum,
and should be steadied by seizing it with a tenaculum.
The cervical canal should then be wiped out
with cotton either in the grasp of long thin forceps or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
upon an applicator. The cervical mucus should be removed
in this way, in order to permit the direct application
of the desired solution to the mucous membrane.
The applicator or forceps, armed with cotton saturated with
the solution, should be introduced in the cervical canal
and applied to all portions of the mucous membrane.</p>

<p>In place of the applicator we may use the glass pipette
or instillation-tube (<a href="#fig_110">Fig. 110</a>), as recommended by Skene.
This instrument, charged with a few drops of the solution,
should be introduced as far as the internal os, and
the solution should be expressed as the pipette is slowly
withdrawn.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_110" src="images/fig_110.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 110.</span>&mdash;Instillation-tube.</p></div>

<p>In most cases of cervical catarrh the external os is sufficiently
large and the canal sufficiently patulous to permit
the applications already described. Sometimes, however,
when the external os and the canal are contracted,
it is desirable to dilate slightly with the small uterine
dilators before making the application. Such dilatation
to one-quarter or one-half an inch may be performed
without an anesthetic, and may be repeated as
often as necessary.</p>

<p>Various solutions are used for application to the cervical
canal. Violent caustics should be avoided. The
solutions of mild strength are preferable. A solution of
1 or 2 grains to the ounce of chloride of zinc, sulphate
of zinc, tannic acid, nitrate of silver (5 to 10 per cent.), or
bichloride of mercury (1:1000) is often useful. An application
of pure carbolic acid is sometimes followed by good
results. Perhaps the most generally useful application is
Churchill’s tincture of iodine or a solution of 2 parts of
tincture of iodine and 1 part of carbolic acid.

<h3 id="CONGENITAL_EROSION_AND_SPLIT_OF_THE_CERVIX">CONGENITAL EROSION AND SPLIT OF THE CERVIX.</h3>

<p>In describing the lesions of laceration of the cervix and
cervical catarrh, frequent mention has been made of the
cervical erosion or the catarrhal patch. The erosion,
or red granular area, surrounding the external os seems
to be caused by various factors. In laceration it is due
to the eversion and exposure of the normal cervical
mucous membrane, and perhaps to slight proliferation
of the cylindrical cells of this mucous membrane on
to the mucous membrane of the vaginal aspect of the
cervix. In cervical catarrh it is caused by swelling
and prolapse of the mucous membrane of the cervical
canal, and extension of the inflammatory process beyond
the limits of the external os, with partial desquamation
of the squamous cells.</p>

<p>There are other cases, however, in which the erosion
appears to be congenital. Such erosions have been observed
by Fischel and other investigators surrounding the
external os in new-born infants. Erosion of this character
has been found, in a more or less marked degree,
in 36 per cent. of new-born infants. Microscopically,
these erosions appear to be a direct continuation of the
mucous membrane of the cervical canal. They are
covered with a single layer of cylindrical epithelium,
and they possess mucous glands, resembling in these
features the cervical mucous membrane, and not the
mucous membrane of the vaginal aspect of the cervix,
which, it will be remembered, is covered with squamous
epithelium and contains no glands. This congenital
erosion usually is of very limited extent, but in some
cases it covers the greater part of the vaginal aspect of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
the cervix, and may then give rise to decided symptoms.
The condition is due to imperfect development of
the external os. In the well-formed woman there is, at
the external os, a sharp line of demarcation between the
squamous epithelium of the vaginal aspect and the cylindrical
epithelium of the cervical canal. In the congenital
erosion the epithelium of the canal extends beyond the
limits of the external os, and meets the squamous epithelium
at a lower level than normal.</p>

<p>Such congenital erosions usually give rise to no trouble,
though perhaps they predispose the woman to cervical
catarrh as a result of exposure of the mucous membrane.
In extreme cases, however, in which the cylindrical epithelium
of the cervical canal persists over the greater
part of the vaginal cervix, and in which the glandular
elements of the canal are found on the vaginal aspect, a
distinct pathological condition arises. The symptoms of
this condition resemble closely those of laceration of the
cervix with ectropion. There is backache, a feeling of
weight in the pelvis, and perhaps
some ovarian pain. In addition,
the woman complains of a leucorrhea
presenting the characteristics
of the cervical mucus. Decided
nervous and digestive disturbances
may be present.</p>

<p>If this condition of congenital
ectropion exists along with a laceration
of the cervix, the diagnosis
becomes very difficult. If, however,
we can exclude the possibility
of a former conception, we may
by careful study determine the real
nature of the case.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_111" src="images/fig_111.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 111.</span>&mdash;Congenital erosion
of the cervix.</p></div>

<p><a href="#fig_111">Fig. 111</a> represents the appearance
of the cervix in a case of
marked congenital erosion in a virtuous single woman
twenty years of age. It will be observed that the appearance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
resembles somewhat that seen in a bilateral laceration
of the cervix with eversion. The following are the
points of difference:</p>

<p>In <i>laceration</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a history of previous pregnancy.</p>

<p>The presenting face of the cervix is oval, with the long
axis antero-posterior.</p>

<p>The angles of laceration may be determined, by sight
or touch, either as more or less well-marked depressions
or as hard plugs in case they are filled up by scar-tissue.
The mucous membrane of the cervical canal may
be made out as a strip on the anterior and posterior lips,
from which there extends laterally a more or less well-marked
erosion.</p>

<p>The vaginal cervix is not of the general mushroom
shape seen in the figure.</p>

<p>If microscopic examination of the cervix be made,
racemose glands will be found discharging only on the
mucous membrane of the cervical canal&mdash;not all over the
vaginal aspect.</p>

<p>In the <i>congenital ectropion</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>There may be no history of pregnancy.</p>

<p>The presenting face of the cervix is approximately
circular.</p>

<p>There is no angle of laceration determined by sight or
touch.</p>

<p>The erosion may extend evenly around the external os,
and there is no one strip that corresponds to the exposed
mucous membrane of the cervical canal.</p>

<p>The vaginal cervix is mushroom-shaped, with a decided
stalk.</p>

<p>Microscopic examination reveals racemose glands discharging
over the greater part of the vaginal cervix, to the
sides of the external os, as well as in front of and behind it.</p>

<p>The ultimate test of this condition is the discovery of
the glands discharging on the vaginal aspect of a cervix
in which the mucous membrane of the cervical canal had
not been exposed by laceration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>The treatment of congenital erosion of the cervix,
when it is so marked as to produce distinct symptoms, is
amputation of the cervix.</p>

<p><b>Congenital Split of the Cervix.</b>&mdash;There is sometimes
found a congenital split of the cervix, closely resembling
a unilateral or bilateral laceration following
labor or miscarriage. The recognition of this fact is of
great medico-legal importance. One of the most positive
signs of a former conception is a laceration of the cervix.
In some cases, however, a condition resembling such a
laceration may exist from birth. Marked lateral split of
the cervix has been discovered in the new-born infant,
and several cases have been observed in which this condition
has been found in adults of undoubted virginity.</p>

<p>It is possible that this condition may become pathological.
Cervical catarrh might be produced from exposure
of the mucous membrane of the cervical canal. The
lesion, however, is not of nearly such serious moment as
a laceration after miscarriage or labor, for the last injury
occurs in a uterus which must undergo involution, and
the chief symptoms of laceration of the cervix are usually
those incident to arrested involution.

<p><b id="CERVICAL_POLYPI">Cervical Polypi.</b>&mdash;Polypoid tumors are found growing
from the mucous membrane of the cervical canal,
projecting into the canal or protruding from the external
os. The mucous polypus is the most usual form, and is
caused by cystic degeneration of the Nabothian glands
of the cervical mucous membrane. Sometimes such
polypi protrude from the ostium vaginæ. Less often
a papillary or warty growth is found on the mucous
membrane of the cervical canal, in the neighborhood of
the external os. There is usually present dilatation of
the external os and cervical canal. The symptoms
of cervical polypi are not characteristic. Inflammation
of the cervical mucous membrane and cervical catarrh
may result. There may be slight, and rarely profuse,
bleeding from the external os. The bleeding may follow
efforts at straining, sexual connection, long standing, or
exercise. Occurring at the time of the menopause or
later, this symptom would excite the suspicion of beginning
cancer of the cervix.</p>

<p>Pediculated polypi should be twisted or cut away.
Bleeding is usually very slight. The sessile growths,
like the papillomata, should be excised, the incision being
carried well below the base of the tumor into the
healthy tissue of the cervix. The wound may then be
closed with an interrupted suture. In every case of such
tumor a careful microscopical examination should be
made to determine its benign or malignant character.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
this condition there is a marked increase in the
length of the vaginal portion of the cervix uteri, though
the thickness of the cervix may be but little, if any,
greater than normal. The vaginal cervix may be so long
that the external os may lie outside the ostium vaginæ.</p>

found in the virgin.</p>

<p>The diagnosis between elongation of the vaginal cervix
and the various forms of prolapse of the uterus and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
vagina may be readily made. In elongation of the vaginal
cervix the fundus uteri is at the normal level; there
is no inversion of the vagina; the vaginal fornices are in
the normal position.</p>

<p>Elongation of the vaginal cervix to a degree sufficient
to be considered pathological is very rare.</p>

<p>The treatment consists in amputation of the cervix.</p>

<p><b id="CHANCRE_OF_THE_CERVIX">Chancre of the Cervix.</b>&mdash;Chancre of the cervix is a
rare lesion. One observer, Rassennone, found 117 uterine
chancres in a series of 1375 cases of venereal sores on
the female genitals. The sore may occur on either lip
of the cervix and may extend into the cervical canal.
The appearance is that characteristic of similar sores in
other parts of the body.</p>

<p>The diagnosis may be made from a history of coitus
with a man having active syphilis, by microscopic examination
if necessary, and by the later appearance of secondary
syphilitic symptoms.</p>

<p><b id="TUBERCULOSIS_OF_THE_CERVIX">Tuberculosis of the Cervix.</b>&mdash;Tuberculosis of the
cervix is a very rare condition. The appearance of the
cervix in such cases resembles that of cancer. In fact,
hysterectomy has been performed for this condition
under the mistaken diagnosis of malignant disease.</p>

<p>The diagnosis may be made by the microscopic examination
of the discharge and of excised tissue.</p>

<p>Complete hysterectomy should be performed for tuberculosis
of the cervix.

<h3 id="CANCER_OF_THE_CERVIX_UTERI">CANCER OF THE CERVIX UTERI.</h3>

<p>Cancer of the cervix uteri is a very common disease.
About one-third of all cases of cancer in women affect
the uterus. Like cancer in other parts of the body, the
disease has been observed at almost every period of life
except infancy. It occurs most frequently during the
active mature life of the woman, between the ages of
thirty and fifty. It is probable that more cases occur
during the latter decade of this period than during the
former.</p>

<p>Cancer of the cervix is a disease of the childbearing
woman. It is very rare in women who have never conceived.
Statistics show that women who develop cancer
of the cervix have borne on an average five children.
The stout, well-nourished mother of a large family is
very prone to cancer of the cervix.</p>

<p>It is probable that the chief predisposing cause of cancer
of the cervix is a fissure or laceration caused by miscarriage
or labor. A focus of irritation, an area of diminished
resistance, is thus developed, where cancer may
start in a woman predisposed to this disease. In some of
the cases of cancer of the cervix occurring in sterile
women it has been found that previous traumatism had
been inflicted by dilatation or incision of the cervix.</p>

<p>Cancer of the cervix uteri originates in one of three
structures: I. The squamous epithelium covering the
vaginal aspect of the cervix; II. The cylindrical cells
lining the cervical canal; III. The epithelial cells of the
cervical glands. The first variety is called squamous-cell
carcinoma of the cervix. The second and third
varieties are called adeno-carcinoma of the cervix.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>The early appearance of the disease, the gross form
assumed by the cancer, the direction of growth, and the
clinical course depend upon the place of origin. In the
late stages of the disease, characterized by extensive destruction
of tissue, all forms appear alike.</p>

<p>I. Cancer of the vaginal aspect of the cervix (squamous-cell
carcinoma) very often begins in a benign erosion of
an old laceration. The early stages of transition from
the benign to the malignant condition are not apparent
to the unaided senses, and can be recognized only by the
microscope. Later a superficial ulceration is developed,
or the cancer may assume the polypoid or vegetating form,
and become readily recognized by the unaided senses.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_114" src="images/fig_114.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 114.</span>&mdash;Cancer of the vaginal aspect of the cervix.</p></div>

<p>It will be remembered that true ulceration as a benign
condition is very rare on the cervix uteri. The erosion
of a laceration is in no sense an ulceration. An ulceration
of the cervix, therefore, should always excite the
gravest suspicion. The polypoid or vegetating growths
vary very much in size. They are sometimes very exuberant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
forming large cauliflower-like masses filling the
upper part of the vagina (<a href="#fig_114">Fig. 114</a>). In other cases they
are small warty growths or rounded protuberances about
the size of a pea. The disease usually spreads to the
mucous membrane of the vagina. Less often it extends
to the cervical canal and to the body of the uterus.</p>

<p>II. When the cancer begins in the mucous membrane
of the cervical canal (adeno-carcinoma), extensive destruction
of tissue may take place before any appearance
of the disease is observed at the external os (<a href="#fig_115">Fig. 115</a>).
This is most likely to occur in those cases in which there
is not present a bilateral laceration of the cervix with
eversion of the mucous membrane. In some cases the
whole of the cervix is destroyed, leaving only a shell, the
lower portion of which is the vaginal aspect of the cervix.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_115" src="images/fig_115.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 115.</span>&mdash;Cancer of the cervical canal, with metastasis to the vagina.</p></div>

<p>When the cervix is lacerated and the mucous membrane
of the canal is exposed, the disease is more early
apparent, and we may then observe the malignant ulceration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
of the exposed mucous membrane or the presence
on it of cancerous outgrowths. This form of cancer of
the cervix uteri is more likely to extend upward to the
endometrium than is the form first described.</p>

<p>III. When the cancer begins in the distal ends of the
cervical glands (adeno-carcinoma), it may appear as a nodule
in the body of the cervix. It will be remembered that
sometimes these glands become so distended peripherally
that they appear beneath the mucous membrane of the vaginal
aspect of the cervix as Nabothian cysts. In a similar
way, when the glands become seats of cancerous infection,
hard nodules of various size may appear or be felt beneath
the vaginal mucous membrane. In other cases the nodule
is situated beneath the mucous membrane of the cervical
canal. These nodules disintegrate and perforate the
overlying mucous membrane, and in this way form a
malignant ulcer which may appear either in the cervical
canal or on the vaginal aspect of the cervix.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_116" src="images/fig_116.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 116.</span>&mdash;Nodular cancer of the neck of the uterus (<i>a</i>) (Ruge and Veit).</p></div>

<p>As has been said, when ulceration and destruction take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
place, in the last stages of the disease, all the varieties of
cancer present a similar appearance and are accompanied
by similar symptoms.</p>

<p>Cancer of the cervix uteri may extend to the vagina,
to the body of the uterus, to the broad ligaments, the
bladder, rectum, ureters, and the peritoneum, and it may
be carried by the lymphatic vessels to the pelvic and
inguinal lymphatic glands.</p>

<p>In nearly all cases of long standing the upper part of
the vagina is involved. Sometimes the whole of the
vaginal canal, from the cervix to the vulva, is infiltrated
with cancerous growths.</p>

<p>The body of the uterus always becomes involved sooner
or later. This is most apt to occur in those cases in
which the disease begins in the cervical canal. The
endometrium is affected by direct extension, the malignant
disease being often preceded by some benign form
of endometritis.</p>

<p>Sometimes the cervix becomes hypertrophied by general
infiltration to three or four times its usual size.</p>

<p>The broad ligaments are very usually involved by direct
extension of the disease. They become thick, hard, and
very rigid, holding the uterus fixed in the pelvis. When
only one ligament is affected, the uterus is drawn to that
side. The ureters become involved by extension of the
infiltration to their walls or by pressure upon them by
the thickened broad ligaments.</p>

<p>The bladder, on account of its close relationship to the
cervix, is always involved in the last stages. The disease
may extend to the vesical mucous membrane, and symptoms
of cystitis will appear. Sometimes the vesico-vaginal
septum is destroyed and a urinary fistula results.
Extension to the rectum is not so common. As the disease
extends upward the peritoneum may be perforated,
though this is an unusual accident. In most cases peritoneal
involvement is preceded by local inflammation and
by adhesions which prevent direct penetration of the
peritoneal cavity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>The pelvic and retroperitoneal lymphatic glands become
affected in the later stages of cancer of the cervix.</p>

<p>The inguinal glands are rarely involved in the last
stages of the disease. Metastasis to remote parts of the
body is unusual. Cancer of the cervix usually remains
localized and does not become metastatic.</p>

<p>From this description it will be observed that in the
early stages of cancer of the cervix the disease presents a
variety of appearances. As cure of the disease depends
upon its early recognition, it is of the utmost importance
that the physician should be familiar with these early
phenomena.</p>

<p>When cancer begins in an erosion of a laceration, we
find that the eroded surface bleeds more easily than in the
non-malignant condition, and is somewhat more elevated
than the surrounding surface of the cervix. We may by
palpation detect around the erosion a more or less indurated
edge which is not felt around a benign erosion.
The submucous structures of the cervix may feel brawny
and indurated. If the erosion has become an ulcer, the
indurated edges and the involvement of the deeper structures
of the cervix are more marked. It must always be
remembered that an ulcer of the cervix is very rare as a
benign condition.</p>

<p>In the vegetating form of cancer of the cervix we may
find small warty growths, or large cauliflower-like masses,
or rounded or irregular protuberances growing from the
surface of the cervix. There is here also felt an induration
around the base of the growth and throughout the
cervix.</p>

<p>A very striking characteristic of cancerous growths of
the cervix uteri is their friability. The warty growths
or cauliflower-like masses break off readily upon even
gentle palpation, and profuse bleeding often results.
There is no other disease of the cervix in which the
outgrowths are of such a friable and vascular character.
Even in the ulcerated form of cancer the edges of the
ulcer are of this same friable nature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p>When the disease begins immediately within the external
os, this opening becomes enlarged, the cervical
canal is destroyed, and there is presented the appearance
of a deep conical excavation, with ulcerated, unhealthy
edges, in the center of the vaginal cervix. When the
disease begins still higher up, the cervical canal may be
the seat of extensive destruction of tissue before any
lesion is visible below the external os. Usually, however,
the os is sufficiently open to permit the condition
of the canal above to be seen.</p>

<p>When the disease begins in the racemose glands of the
cervix, the nodules may be felt beneath the mucous membrane
of the vaginal aspect of the cervix. The whole
cervix is usually indurated and somewhat enlarged. The
mucous membrane overlying the nodule may appear congested,
and upon palpation it is found that the overlying
mucous membrane does not glide readily over the nodule,
but seems to be more than normally adherent to the
underlying structures.</p>

<p>In all the forms of cancer of the cervix there is present
to a greater or less extent a general induration of the
cervix. The elasticity or resiliency of the cervix is
diminished or lost; this is shown not only by the sensation
upon palpation, but by the fact that the cervix is
not capable of dilatation, by sponge tent or otherwise, as
in the normal condition.</p>

<p>In the last stages of the disease the gross appearance
is the same in all forms of cancer of the cervix. The
cervix may fill the whole vaginal vault, sometimes hypertrophied
to the size of the adult fist. The presenting
mass is ulcerated, gangrenous, and covered with friable
vegetations bathed in thin fetid pus and blood. The
vaginal vault itself is usually involved by extension of
the disease. The body of the uterus is found to be enlarged,
and the mass of the cervix is held rigidly in the
pelvis by the thickened cancerous broad ligaments.</p>

<p>In some other cases, instead of a protruding mass we
discover an immense crater in the vaginal vault&mdash;a crater
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
with indurated edges and sides, surmounted by the
body of the uterus. The size of the crater shows that
the destruction of tissue has extended far beyond the
normal limits of the vaginal and supra-vaginal cervices.
The interior of the crater presents an ulcerated, sloughing
surface.</p>

<p>There is no condition which should be mistaken for
cancer of the cervix in the last stages. A sloughing
uterine polyp presents superficially a similar appearance,
but the gangrenous mass will be found surrounded by a
ring or collar, often very attenuated, of healthy cervical
tissue, and the presenting tumor is usually elastic to the
touch, not unyielding and friable like the cancerous mass.</p>

<p>In the early stages of cancer the appearance resembles
closely the erosion of a bilateral laceration of the cervix.
In the simple laceration, however, the erosion is soft, not
indurated; there are no palpable edges; the cervix is not
brawny; and it will be found that the simple erosion
yields to local treatment, while the cancerous erosion
does not.</p>

<p>Syphilitic ulceration and the ulceration of lupus are
very rare upon the cervix. Syphilitic ulceration sometimes
presents all the gross appearances of cancer. The
history, the microscopical examination, and the therapeutic
test will enable one to make a differential diagnosis.</p>

<p>Cystic degeneration of the cervix should not be mistaken
for the nodular form of cancer, for the cysts may
be seen and punctured and their character determined.</p>

<p>Benign fibroid tumors of the cervix are very rare,
are usually single, and are larger than the nodules of
cancer.</p>

<p>In every case of doubt, in every case in which the
physician has the least cause to suspect malignancy,
microscopic examination of an excised portion of tissue
should be made. Examination of tissue scraped off
should not be relied upon. The most suspicious portion
of tissue should be seized with a tenaculum and freely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
cut out. Pieces of tissue may be thus excised from two
or more situations. In the nodular form of cancer a
nodule should be seized and excised. It is perfectly
justifiable, in cases which cannot thus be elucidated, to
amputate the cervix and examine the whole structure.</p>

<p>The excision of small pieces of tissue may be done
without an anesthetic, as little or no pain is caused by
the operation. Bleeding is very slight, and may always
be controlled by a light vaginal compress of gauze or
cotton. If the case is not malignant, healing is rapid.
The specimen removed should be placed in absolute
alcohol and submitted to microscopical examination by an
experienced pathologist.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms of Cancer of the Cervix.</b>&mdash;A study of
the early symptoms of cancer of the cervix is of the
greatest importance. In the early stages the disease may
be eradicated with every probability of permanent cure.
Cancer of the uterus is more favorable for surgical attack
than cancer in most other parts of the body. Excision
of the disease is not done in the continuity of an organ
or a structure, but the whole organ attached by distinct
structures may be removed.</p>

<p>The great majority of women with cancer of the cervix
come to the operator when the disease has extended
too far to permit any radical treatment. Hopeless palliation
is the only course to be followed. This unfortunate
condition of things is due to the ignorance of the
woman in regard to the significance of the early symptoms
of the disease, and to the failure of the physician
first consulted to insist upon a thorough examination as
soon as any suspicious symptoms appear.</p>

<p>There is no one symptom of cancer of the cervix
present in all cases, and all the common symptoms may
be absent in exceptional cases until the last stages of the
disease&mdash;until the disease has extended so far that cure
is impossible. It is of great importance to remember this
fact, so that the absence of one or more of the classical
symptoms of cancer shall not engender a feeling of security
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
that may cause the postponement of a thorough
physical examination.</p>

<p>The usual symptoms of cancer of the cervix are hemorrhage,
pain, and discharge.</p>

<p><i>Hemorrhage.</i>&mdash;The first symptom that should direct
our attention to this disease is bleeding from the vagina.
Such hemorrhage often first appears as a menorrhagia&mdash;as
an increase in the amount of blood lost at the normal
menstrual periods. The loss of blood may be greater,
and the duration of the period longer. Sometimes, if
the woman keeps quiet during the period, the loss of
blood and the duration are about as usual; but if she is
upon her feet the loss is increased, and if she begins an
active life immediately after the usual duration of the
menstrual period has elapsed, bleeding may reappear for
one or more days.</p>

<p>In other cases slight bleeding appears in the menstrual
interval. A spot of blood may be discovered upon the
clothing. The accustomed leucorrheal discharge may
occasionally be streaked with blood. Such appearances
are most frequent after long walking or standing or physical
work, or after straining at stool, or very often after
coitus.</p>

<p>If the woman has passed the menopause, the hemorrhage
of cancer may appear as a re-establishment of menstruation&mdash;often
to the satisfaction of the woman. This
post-climacteric bleeding may occur with more or less
regularity&mdash;every month or every three or four months&mdash;or
it may appear as an occasional loss of blood after unwonted
effort.</p>

<p>All hemorrhage of this kind, in women over thirty
years of age, demands immediate and careful physical
examination. Any bleeding from the vagina in a woman
who has passed the menopause should arouse the gravest
suspicion. From the slight hemorrhages just described
the bleeding increases in intensity and duration, until
there is a continuous loss of blood that saps the strength
of the woman and produces the profound anemia characteristic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
of the last stages of cancer of the cervix,
Sudden fatal hemorrhage in this disease is rare.</p>

<p><i>Pain</i> is not a constant accompaniment of cancer of
the cervix in the early stages, nor is it in any way characteristic.
The intensity and character of the pain may
depend upon the direction of the growth of the disease.
In some cases pain is absent throughout. The pain may
be dull and gnawing in character, or it may be sharp and
lancinating. The pain may resemble that of uterine
colic. It may be referred to the back in the region of
the sacrum, or to one or both ovarian regions, or to some
part of the pelvis remote from the uterus, as the crest or
the anterior superior spine of the ilium. It may extend
down the posterior or anterior aspects of the thighs or
into the rectum. In most cases of cancer of the cervix
pain is not a prominent symptom until the later stages.</p>

<p><i>Discharge</i> from the vagina may be present in cancer of
the cervix before there are any symptoms of hemorrhage
or pain. The discharge depends upon the position and
character of the growth and the stage of the disease. It
may first appear as an ordinary cervical leucorrhea in a
woman previously free from such discharge; or the discharge
of cancer may first appear as an increase of an
accustomed leucorrhea. In such cases it is due to hypersecretion
from the irritated cervical glands.</p>

<p>Later in the disease, when ulceration takes place or
when the friable vascular vegetations appear, the leucorrhea
becomes puriform in character and streaked with
blood. It then becomes thinner, less mucous in consistency,
and of a constant brownish color from the admixture
of blood. The pus and débris from the breaking-down
cancerous mass increase, and a horrible odor
characteristic of the later stages of cancer of the cervix
appears. This odor is not peculiar to cancer. It is
caused by the sloughing tissue, and is observed when
such a process occurs in other conditions, as in sloughing
fibroid polyp. The discharge is irritating in character,
and the ostium vaginæ, the vulva, and the inner aspects
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
of the thighs become excoriated in those who do not observe
strict cleanliness.</p>

<p>Systemic absorption of the cancerous discharges produces
a general septic condition, which, with the anemia
from hemorrhage and the uremia from obstruction of the
ureters, results in the so-called cancerous cachexia.</p>

<p>The symptoms that have just been described are those
most usual in cases of cancer. It must always be remembered,
however, that these symptoms vary very much
in intensity or prominence and in the stage of the disease
at which they appear. Sometimes acute pain, hemorrhage,
and excessive discharge are present from the very
beginning&mdash;even before the presence of cancer can be
demonstrated without the aid of the microscope. In
other cases all these symptoms may be absent until the
disease is very far advanced. None of the symptoms are
absolutely pathognomonic of cancer. During the menstrual
life of the woman hemorrhage from the womb
occurs as a symptom of a great variety of diseases; and
even in the post-climacteric period, though hemorrhage
should always excite alarm, yet it may be caused by a benign
form of endometritis or intra-uterine growth. The
pain of cancer may also characterize a variety of benign
conditions; and the vaginal discharge, even when most
offensive, may be simulated by that from a sloughing
intra-uterine fibroid.</p>

<p>The symptoms, however slight, which we know may
occur with cancer of the cervix should never be disregarded.
Examination should be made immediately.
There should be no postponement or expectant plan of
treatment. If physical examination is not satisfactory in
elucidating the condition, resort should be had to the
microscope. If this is not conclusive, the case should be
watched as long as the suspicious symptoms continue, and
further frequent examinations should be made.</p>

<p>If this plan of treatment is followed, and if women are
taught to view with distrust, and not with complacency,
any irregularities of menstruation occurring near the time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
of the menopause, or any post-climacteric return of menstruation
or of irregular bleeding, the surgeon will be
able to save many women with cancer of the womb who
are now doomed to horrible deaths.</p>

<p>Cancer of the cervix, like cancer in other parts of the
body, is of variable duration. Usually from one to three
years elapse between the time when the first symptoms
of the disease appear and the time of death. The disease
may run its course, in exceptional cases, in a few
weeks; in other cases it may last as long as five years,
especially if the progress is delayed by palliative treatment.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;Complete removal of the uterus is the
only curative treatment for cancer of the cervix. If the
disease is seen in the earliest stages, amputation of the
cervix beyond the limits of the growth seems, theoretically
at least, to be a proper plan of treatment. Practically,
however, the operator can never be certain that
the excision is made in healthy tissue. The senses of
touch and unaided sight are not capable of defining the
limits of malignant infiltration. Moreover, it must be
remembered that the endometrium is very often involved
secondarily from a cancerous focus in the cervix. Complete
removal of the uterus should therefore always be
practised in all cases in which there is a possibility of
removing all of the disease.</p>

<p>The manner of performing this operation will be
described subsequently.</p>

<p>The cases that are not suitable for the operation of
hysterectomy are those in which the disease has extended
to structures that are surgically inaccessible. Such cases
include those in which the bladder or the rectum are involved,
those in which the vagina is extensively implicated,
and those in which the disease has extended into
the broad ligaments or the cellular tissue of the pelvis.</p>

<p>When the bladder is involved, there are dysuria, vesical
pain, and tenderness on vaginal pressure upon the base
of the bladder, while the urine is altered in character,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
containing blood, pus, and, in the later stages, broken-down
necrotic tissue. Involvement of the rectum is
manifest by digital examination.</p>

<p>When the broad ligaments are involved the uterus is
held rigidly in the pelvis or is drawn to one side, and the
bases of the broad ligaments, palpated through the lateral
vaginal fornices, are thick and hard. When the cellular
tissue of the pelvis is generally involved the whole vaginal
vault feels indurated and the uterus seems fixed in
the unyielding matrix.</p>

<p>In examining with the view of determining the practicability
of hysterectomy, it is important to distinguish
between cancerous and simple inflammatory involvement
of the broad ligaments. The uterus may be fixed in the
pelvis by inflammatory adhesions resulting from old tubal
disease, and yet the cancer of the cervix may be strictly
local and in a stage suitable for hysterectomy. In the
simple inflammatory cases the adhesions are more attenuated,
are higher in the pelvis, and lie chiefly posterior to
the uterus. They are not directly continuous with the
cervix. Frequently the enlarged tube and the adherent
ovary may be felt. When the uterus is fixed by cancerous
involvement of the broad ligament, we readily feel
that it is the base of the broad ligament that is involved.
The induration is broad, it is directly continuous with
the induration of the cervix, and it lies to the side of the
uterus.</p>

<p>Involvement of the pelvic lymphatic glands may sometimes
be determined by vaginal palpation, one or more
such enlarged indurated glands being felt lying posterior
to the uterus. In most cases, however, glandular involvement
can be determined only after the abdomen has
been opened.</p>

<p>In general, it may be said that the operation of hysterectomy
should be performed in all cases in which there
is no cancerous involvement of the bladder and rectum,
in which the vaginal disease may all be removed, and in
which the uterus is freely movable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>In those cases in which complete removal of the disease
is impossible the operation of hysterectomy should
not be performed, because, cure being out of the question,
the symptoms of hemorrhage, pain, and discharge
may be as well relieved by less dangerous forms of palliative
treatment. When the disease extends beyond the
limits of the uterus, hysterectomy is much more difficult
and dangerous than when the uterus is freely movable.</p>

<p>The remote results of hysterectomy for cancer of the
cervix are poor. In the very great majority of all cases
submitted to operation recurrence has taken place. It
seems very probable that a few of the cases of recurrence
are due to transplantation of cancer-cells into healthy
tissue during the operation; but the vast majority die
because all of the diseased tissues have not been or can
not be removed. The hope for better results from the
surgical treatment of cancer of the cervix depends, not
upon improvement in the surgical technique, but upon
the ability of the general practitioner to recognize the
disease in its earliest stages, before inaccessible structures
have been involved.</p>

<p><i>Palliative Treatment of Cancer of the Cervix.</i>&mdash;The
palliative treatment consists in removing as thoroughly
as possible, with the sharp spoon-curette, scissors, or
knife, all the cancerous cervix, and the maintenance of
the surfaces thus exposed, as far as possible, free from
septic infection.</p>

<p>The woman should be placed in the lithotomy position;
the cervix should be exposed with the Sims speculum
and, if necessary, with the lateral vaginal retractors.
All vegetations and all of the degenerated cervix should
then be cut away. It is usually necessary to carry the
excision of tissue as high as the internal os. Bleeding
during this procedure is sometimes very profuse. It
diminishes, however, as the more degenerated portions of
the cervix are cut away and the healthier uterine tissue
is reached, and therefore it is always best to complete the
operation, notwithstanding hemorrhage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<p>The bleeding may be controlled by packing the cavity
with gauze or cotton, plain or saturated with Monsel’s
solution. Moderate bleeding may be checked by packing
with cotton saturated with a 5 per cent. solution of antipyrine.</p>

<p>In rare cases, in which the excision of tissue has been
carried high up in the lateral vaginal fornices, it may be
necessary to ligate the uterine arteries in order to control
the hemorrhage. This may be done by passing around
the vessel, close to the cervix, a curved needle carrying
a heavy ligature. Bleeding from the circular artery may
readily be controlled in a similar way, the ligature being
passed like the first suture in trachelorrhaphy.</p>

<p>If the operation has been thoroughly performed, there
will be left a large crater or conical cavity in the vaginal
vault. This cavity may then be packed with sterile
gauze, or, if there is much bleeding, with gauze saturated
with Monsel’s solution. Some surgeons sew together the
walls of the cavity to diminish as much as possible the
raw surface. Others char the walls with the actual
cautery, in order to carry the destruction of tissue still
farther than has been done with the knife. If the removal
with the curette and knife has been thorough, it is
not necessary to make a caustic application. If, however,
the cavity is walled by obviously cancerous tissue,
the use of the caustic is advisable. This is usually the
case.</p>

<p>Chloride of zinc is a valuable caustic in cancer of the
cervix. It should be applied as follows: After the cancerous
tissue has been removed as thoroughly as possible
with the knife, the scissors, and the curette, bleeding
from the walls of the cavity should be checked by packing
with gauze, dry or saturated with a 5 per cent. solution
of antipyrine. The bleeding may very often be
checked in this way in a few minutes, and in this case
the caustic may be immediately applied. In case, however,
the bleeding is not so quickly controlled, the packing
must be left in the cavity for twenty-four hours, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
the end of which time it may be removed, without anesthesia,
and the caustic application may be made.</p>

<p>Before introducing the caustic the vagina and the vulva
should be protected by thorough greasing with an ointment
composed of 1 part of bicarbonate of soda to 3
parts of vaseline.</p>

<p>The strength of the caustic should depend somewhat
upon the thickness of the tissue that separates the cavity
from the peritoneum or other important structures. The
thickness may be approximately determined by palpation.
Usually a 100 per cent. solution of chloride of zinc may
be safely employed. If the walls of the cavity appear
very thin&mdash;less than a quarter of an inch&mdash;the caustic
may be reduced to a 50 per cent. solution. Small balls
of cotton, about half an inch in diameter, should be
saturated with the caustic and carefully packed in the
cavity. The operator should be careful to remove quickly
with the sponge any excess of caustic that may be expressed
from the cotton. Much unnecessary pain may be
experienced if the caustic comes in contact with the vagina
or the vulva.</p>

<p>When the cavity has been filled with the cotton balls
carrying the chloride of zinc, a large vaginal tampon of
cotton well greased with the alkaline ointment should be
placed in the vaginal vault. The packing should be removed
from the vagina in forty-eight hours, and vaginal
douches of bichloride of mercury, 1:4000, should be administered.</p>

<p>If this operation is carefully performed, the subsequent
pain is usually slight. In some cases, however, the
action of the caustic may be so painful that morphine is
required.</p>

<p>The slough from the caustic may be discharged in one
piece or in shreds. It is usually separated in from five
to ten days.</p>

<p>The subsequent treatment of the woman consists in the
frequent use of cleansing vaginal douches, such as a solution
of bichloride of mercury (1:4000), carbolic acid (3
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
per cent. solution), permanganate of potash (10 grains to
the ounce of water), and peroxide of hydrogen (1 part of
the commercial peroxide to 3 or 4 parts of water).</p>

<p>The palliative treatment of cancer relieves the pain,
the hemorrhage, and the discharge. The relief is usually
immediate, and may continue throughout the disease.
The hemorrhage is usually arrested for several weeks, or
even for months, and the discharge is much diminished
with the destruction of the necrotic cancerous mass.
The progress of the disease is delayed, and life is somewhat
prolonged.

<h3 id="DISEASES_OF_THE_BODY_OF_THE_UTERUS">DISEASES OF THE BODY OF THE UTERUS.</h3>

<h4 id="ACUTE_CORPOREAL_ENDOMETRITIS">ACUTE CORPOREAL ENDOMETRITIS.</h4>

<p>Acute inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
body of the uterus is called acute corporeal endometritis.
The disease is usually the result of septic infection occurring
at a labor or a miscarriage. Occasionally acute
gonorrheal endometritis is seen, but this disease usually
produces an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
cervix and the body of the uterus that is chronic or subacute
from the beginning. Septic infection through
operative traumatism, through the use of the uterine
sound, or through other gynecological methods of examination
may, of course, result in acute endometritis.</p>

<p>The pathological changes that take place in an endometrium
that is the seat of acute inflammation resemble
those seen in acute inflammation of mucous membranes
of other parts of the body. The secretion of the utricular
glands becomes much increased in quantity and altered
in character, becoming purulent and sometimes containing
blood.</p>

<p>As would be expected, whenever the inflammation is at
all severe the middle or muscular coat of the uterus
is involved by the process; in other words, a <i>metritis</i>
follows and accompanies the endometritis. In puerperal
metritis abscesses varying in size from a pin-head to that
of a hen’s egg are sometimes found in the uterine wall.</p>

<p>The septic infection may extend through the muscular
wall of the uterus and involve the peritoneal covering,
producing in this way a <i>perimetritis</i>.</p>

<p>Acute inflammation of the endometrium sometimes
occurs during the course of the exanthemata. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
changes that take place in the mucous membrane of the
uterus are similar to those seen in other mucous membranes
during the course of these diseases. The local condition
is usually limited by the duration of the general disease.</p>

<p>It is probable that some of the cases of arrested development
of the internal organs of generation, and cases
of chronic tubal and ovarian disease seen in later life,
may be traced to this exanthematous form of endometritis
occurring during girlhood.</p>

<p>The symptoms of acute endometritis vary very much
in severity. Dull pain in the region of the uterus,
referred to the supra-pubic region and the sacrum, is
usually present. Reflex disturbance of the bladder, characterized
by frequent and often painful urination, may
be present; and it is very probable that mild cases of
endometritis have been diagnosed and treated as light
attacks of cystitis. The temperature in the puerperal
cases may be very high. The discharge from the cervix
is very much increased, is puriform in character, and is
occasionally streaked with blood.</p>

<p>Digital examination shows that the external os is patulous,
the cervix enlarged and soft, and the body of the
uterus somewhat enlarged and tender upon pressure.
This tenderness may be elicited by pressing the fundus
between the vaginal finger in the anterior vaginal fornix
and the abdominal hand. Examination through the
speculum shows the discharge escaping from the external
os. In case the cervical mucous membrane is also
involved, a red area of erosion will be seen surrounding
the os.</p>

<p>Acute endometritis of non-puerperal origin is best
treated by rest in bed, vaginal douches of hot boric-acid
solution (ʒj to a pint of water) or of bichloride of
mercury (1:4000) at a temperature of 100° to 110°, and
the continuous use of saline purgatives. Active intra-uterine
treatment in these cases is not necessary.
When, however, the disease occurs, as it usually does,
from septic infection at a miscarriage or a labor, more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
radical treatment must be used. This treatment comprises
frequently-repeated intra-uterine douches, thorough
curetting of the uterus, and, finally, hysterectomy in
extreme cases.</p>

<p>Every case of acute endometritis should be carefully
watched and treated until the disease is cured. Acute
endometritis, especially if gonorrhea is the cause, is very
prone to become chronic and to extend to the mucous
membrane of the Fallopian tubes and the ovaries.</p>

<h4 id="CHRONIC_CORPOREAL_ENDOMETRITIS">CHRONIC CORPOREAL ENDOMETRITIS.</h4>

<p>Chronic inflammation of the endometrium, or chronic
endometritis, is much more frequently seen in practice
than the acute form. It may occur as a primary disease,
but it very often occurs as the result of some other
pathological condition of the uterus, as, for instance, subinvolution
or uterine fibroid.</p>

<p>A variety of confusing terms have been used to designate
the different forms of endometritis. There seem to
be two chief forms of the disease: I. Chronic interstitial
endometritis; II. Chronic glandular endometritis.</p>

<p>In the first form of the disease the interglandular tissue
is chiefly involved. The spaces between the glands are
infiltrated with connective-tissue cells.</p>

<p>In the second or glandular form of endometritis the
disease affects the glandular apparatus. The utricular
glands become much elongated, branched, and increased
in number. The accompanying illustrations (Figs. 117,
118) show the microscopic appearance of interstitial endometritis
and glandular endometritis.</p>

<p>These two forms of endometritis are often mixed, and
the same uterus may present the glandular form of inflammation
upon part of the endometrium, the interstitial
form upon another part, and the mixed form upon
still another part.</p>

<p>The gross appearance of the endometrium varies with
the form of the disease and its duration. It will be remembered
that in the mature uterus, in the menstrual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
interval, the mucous membrane is a thin reddish-gray
structure about 1 millimeter (1/25 inch) in thickness. In
the different forms of endometritis the mucous membrane
may become hypertrophied to three or four times this
thickness. In some unusual cases the mucous membrane
may become even still further hypertrophied, attaining
a thickness of half an inch. A special name, <i>fungous
endometritis</i>, has been given to the disease when it assumes
this form. Microscopic examination shows that
fungous endometritis is merely a mixed form of the
glandular and the interstitial varieties, with a great increase
of all the elements of the mucous membrane. In
fungous endometritis the hypertrophy of the mucous
membrane may be uniform throughout the body of the
uterus or it may occur only in localized areas.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 118.</span>&mdash;Glandular endometritis: microscopic section of endometrium

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_119" src="images/fig_119.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 119.</span>&mdash;Polypoid endometritis (Beyea).</p></div>

<p>In some cases the glandular hypertrophy of the mucous
membrane assumes the form of polypoid growths projecting
into the uterine cavity (<a href="#fig_119">Fig. 119</a>).</p>

<p>In the advanced stages of all the forms of endometritis
cicatricial formation takes place. The normal ciliated
epithelium of the endometrium is cast off, and is replaced
by flat squamous cells. The glands atrophy; the glandular
openings become dilated, and ultimately appear as
simple depressions on the surface. In time secretion
from the glands ceases, and the cavity of the uterus becomes
lined with simple connective tissue.</p>

<p>Chronic endometritis is always accompanied to a greater
or less extent by inflammation of the muscular coat of
the uterus. The pathological changes that take place resemble
those occurring in chronic inflammation in similar
musculo-fibrous structures in other parts of the body.
A section of the uterine wall is much lighter in appearance
than normal, and the whitish bundles of connective
tissue are seen interlacing with the more vascular muscular
fibers.</p>

<p>At first there is an hypertrophy of the uterine wall
from infiltration of inflammatory material. In the latest
stages organized connective tissue is formed, and there is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
produced a sclerotic condition of the uterus, with atrophy
of its normal muscular elements.</p>

<p>The hypertrophy of the uterus, however, that accompanies
most of the forms of endometritis is not due altogether
to the presence of inflammatory deposits. The
uterus possesses the peculiar property of enlarging, by
a general hypertrophy of its elements, whenever there is
present in its cavity any gross pathological condition.
We see this in fibroid tumor. And, as a general rule,
the enlargement is proportional to the mensurable size
of the disease.</p>

<p>The metritis may involve the whole of the uterine
body, or it may occur in localized areas. It may affect
only the body of the uterus, or the body and the cervix,
or, as we have already seen, the cervix alone. When the
disease is localized to part of the uterine wall, the induration
of the affected area may sometimes be determined
by palpation.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;The symptoms of chronic endometritis
are often obscured by symptoms that are to be referred
to other accompanying conditions. For instance, the
endometritis very often accompanies subinvolution of
the uterus, laceration of the cervix, uterine displacement,
or ovarian and tubal disease. Cases of simple
uncomplicated endometritis are the exception.</p>

<p>The menstrual function is usually affected. The period
is of longer duration, the loss of blood is greater, and
the periods may occur more frequently than normal; in
other words, there is present menorrhagia. In this disease
bleeding also occasionally occurs between the menstrual
periods. Hemorrhage is a symptom that is most
prominent in cases of interstitial and fungoid endometritis.</p>

<p>The secretion of the utricular glands is also increased
in amount. This symptom is most pronounced in cases
of glandular endometritis. The secretion is thin and
purulent in character, and is often streaked with blood.
It decomposes very readily, and consequently is often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
offensive and excites the suspicion of malignant disease.</p>

<p>The character of the typical discharge from the body
of the uterus is usually obscured by admixture with discharge
from the cervical mucous membrane. Cervical
catarrh, or inflammation of the cervical mucous membrane,
may, and usually does, occur alone, without involvement
of the upper endometrium, but chronic corporeal
endometritis is usually associated with inflammation
of the cervix. If the discharge is observed at the
vulva, it will be still further altered by admixture with
the vaginal secretion. The discharge from the corporeal
endometrium is thinner and more serous than the mucus
of the cervical canal, and is more usually purulent and
streaked with blood.</p>

<p>The discharge from the endometrium is very often increased
very decidedly immediately before and after the
menstrual period.</p>

<p>Pain is a general symptom of chronic endometritis.
The pain is uterine in character, and is referred to the
lower abdomen and the back. There is also very constantly
present reflex headache localized on the top of
the head or in the occiput.</p>

<p>The pain may be present at all times, but it is usually
most marked when the woman is upon her feet and the
pelvic congestion is increased. The pain is always greatest
immediately before and during the menstrual period.</p>

<p>General physical weakness and debility are often very
pronounced, and seem to be out of proportion to the
extent of the local disease. This same phenomenon has
been spoken of in the consideration of uterine displacements.
The weak and aching back, the dragging sensations
in the pelvis, the tired legs, may all appear after
the woman has been upon her feet but a short time, and
utterly incapacitate her for any kind of labor.</p>

<p>Nervousness, neurasthenia, hysteria, and mental depression
and melancholia are apt to occur in this disease.
Such nervous phenomena are common to all diseases of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
the uterus. The mental depression is often very marked,
and is exaggerated before and during each menstrual
period.</p>

<p>The woman with chronic endometritis is usually
sterile; or if she becomes pregnant, abortion will probably
occur. The discharges in the uterine cavity are
inimical to the spermatozoa, and the diseased endometrium
furnishes an inefficient place for the attachment
of the ovum.</p>

<p>Physical examination in a simple case of chronic endometritis
shows a somewhat enlarged uterus, more globular
in shape than normal. The fundus uteri is tender
on pressure between the vaginal finger and the abdominal
hand. The external os is usually patulous.</p>

<p>Examination with the speculum shows the discharge
escaping from the external os. If there is also present
cervical endometritis, the discharge presents the characteristics
of both cervical and corporeal mucus. It is
thick and tenacious, puriform, and often streaked with
blood. After the cervical canal has been wiped out the
characteristic corporeal discharge may appear unmixed
with cervical mucus. This discharge is thin, purulent,
and may be streaked with blood, or it may be brownish
in color from mixture with altered blood.</p>

<p>If the uterus is examined with the uterine sound, it
will be found that the internal os is patulous; the fundus
is decidedly tender upon gentle pressure with the sound,
and even the gentlest use of the sound may be followed
by bleeding.</p>

<p>The patulous condition of the cervical canal and the
internal os is a constant characteristic of all kinds of
gross disease in the cavity of the uterus. The external os
is usually patulous when the cervical mucous membrane
is diseased. The external os, the cervical canal, and the
internal os are open when the corporeal endometrium is
diseased.</p>

<p>The only certain method of making the diagnosis is
by the use of the sharp uterine curette, and this instrument
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
should always be employed whenever there is even
the slightest suspicion of the possibility of malignant disease
of the endometrium. The cervical canal is usually
sufficiently open to permit the use of the curette without
dilatation and without an anesthetic. Three or four strips
of the endometrium should be removed from different
parts of the uterine cavity, and should be submitted to
microscopic examination. It is always safest to perform
curetting for diagnosis at the house of the patient, and to
keep her in bed for two or three days after the operation.
Strict antisepsis should be observed.</p>

<p>The causes of chronic corporeal endometritis are various.
Almost any disease of the body of the uterus or of
the cervix may eventually result in this condition; therefore
the different causes of chronic endometritis will be
better appreciated after a discussion of diseases of the
uterus. Laceration of the cervix, subinvolution, flexions
and versions, fibroid tumors, etc., all produce, in time,
some form of chronic endometritis.</p>

<p>Primary chronic endometritis may result as a later
stage of the acute disease, or it may exist from the beginning
in the chronic form. This is especially true
of endometritis caused by gonorrhea. Here the invasion
of the disease is slow and insidious, and in the
majority of cases is preceded by no determinable acute
stage.</p>

<p>Sometimes endometritis appears in old women. Bleeding
from the uterus, purulent discharge, and pain may be
present. The condition is due to the atrophic changes
of senility occurring in the endometrium&mdash;changes that
resemble those that take place in the mucous membrane
of the vagina and the external genitals. Though such
symptoms may be indicative merely of a benign condition,
yet, as they are also characteristic of the early stages
of malignant disease, they demand immediate thorough
examination and careful watching.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;As chronic endometritis is usually secondary
to some disease of the cervix or body of the uterus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
the treatment should be directed toward the cure of
this primary condition.</p>

<p>The operation of trachelorrhaphy will cure the subinvolution
of the uterus and the resulting endometritis.
Forcible dilatation of the cervix, in the case of an old
anteflexion, will relieve the inflammation of the endometrium.
Correction of a retroversion will likewise relieve
the resulting endometritis. Therefore, though in
every case the cure may be hastened by treatment applied
directly to the endometrium, yet causative or complicating
conditions must always also be treated if we wish the
cure to be lasting.</p>

<p>Many cases of mild endometritis may be relieved or
cured by attention to the general hygiene and habits of
the woman and by applications made only to the vaginal
aspect of the uterus. The dresses should be worn loose
about the waist and supported from the shoulders. Prolonged
standing and slow walking should be avoided.
Mild purgation with salines should be maintained. Regulated
exercise or general massage should be prescribed.
In addition, the vaginal douche, iodine applications, and
the use of the glycerin tampon, with depletion from
puncture of the cervix, should be used, as has already
been prescribed for the subinvolution accompanying
laceration of the cervix.</p>

<p>If these methods fail after careful trial, direct treatment
must be applied to the endometrium.</p>

<p>The present method of treating chronic corporeal endometritis
directly is by the uterine curette. Time is wasted
by the use of applications to the interior of the uterus,
and a great deal of harm has resulted from such applications
carelessly made.</p>

<p>The best curette is the Sims sharp curette (<a href="#fig_120">Fig. 120</a>).
The Martin curette (<a href="#fig_121">Fig. 121</a>) is useful to remove the
endometrium from the fundus.</p>

<p>The operation had best be performed in the menstrual
interval, though it may safely be performed during the
menstrual period. An anesthetic should always be administered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
The woman should be placed in the dorso-sacral
position, with the feet in the supports. The vulva,
vagina, vaginal cervix, and buttocks should be thoroughly
sterilized.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_120" src="images/fig_120.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 120.</span>&mdash;Sims’s sharp curette.</p></div>

<p>The anterior lip of the cervix should be grasped with a
double tenaculum. The cervical canal should be wiped
out with a small sponge or with cotton and irrigated with
bichloride, if the external os is sufficiently patulous.
The cervical canal and the internal os should then be
dilated to about one inch. The position of the uterus
should have been previously determined by careful bimanual
palpation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_121" src="images/fig_121.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 121.</span>&mdash;Martin’s curette.</p></div>

<p>The Sims curette should be gently introduced to one
cornu and then drawn methodically over the whole of
the uterine surface, removing the endometrium in parallel
strips, the length of each strip being equal to the distance
between the internal os and the fundus. The curette
may be withdrawn from the uterus and washed in distilled
water as each strip is removed, or withdrawal and
washing may be done after two or three strips have been
removed. The Martin curette should then be introduced
to one cornu and scraped over the fundus, as there is usually
in this situation a narrow strip of endometrium that
is not removed by the Sims curette.</p>

<p>The uterus should then be washed out with warm
sterile water or with a 1:4000 bichloride solution. The
washing may be done by holding the cervical canal open
with the small dilator and introducing the long tubular
syringe nozzle, or by some form of reflux tube (<a href="#fig_122">Fig. 122</a>).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Opportunity must always be afforded for the escape of the
irrigating fluid.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_122" src="images/fig_122.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 122.</span>&mdash;Irrigation of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>The operator should always remember the danger of
perforating the uterus by the curette. This accident,
which has happened in the hands of the best surgeons,
occurs usually as the instrument is introduced, not as it
is withdrawn. It is much more liable to occur after labor
or recent abortion, when the uterine tissues are soft, than
in the conditions now under consideration. If perforation
should happen, the uterus should be carefully washed out
with the bichloride solution, the vagina should be lightly
packed with gauze, and the patient returned to bed. A
hypodermic injection of ergotin should be administered,
and afterward, when the woman recovers from the anesthetic,
small repeated doses of fluid extract of ergot
should be administered to ensure uterine contraction. If
the operation has been performed aseptically, it is probable
that no harm will result from the accident. If peritonitis
should develop, celiotomy must immediately be
performed.</p>

<p>After curetting the uterus some operators are in the
habit of packing the uterine cavity with sterile or iodoform
gauze. This procedure is liable to obstruct the
escape, rather than favor the drainage, of any discharges
from the cavity of the uterus. Elevation of temperature
and uterine pain are often caused by it; therefore it is
best, after the operation of curetting, merely to pack the
vagina lightly with sterile gauze, which should be removed
in forty-eight hours. Daily douches of a 1:4000
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
bichloride-of-mercury solution should then be administered
as long as the woman remains in bed. The vagina
should be carefully dried after the douche, as already
advised.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage is never profuse during curetting, and
usually ceases after the endometrium has been removed
and the uterus has been washed out.</p>

<p>In cases of gonorrheal endometritis it is advisable,
after the uterus has been douched and the bleeding has
ceased, to apply carbolic acid thoroughly over the whole
interior of the uterus, because infection may lurk in the
distal ends of the utricular glands, which are not removed
by the curette.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_123" src="images/fig_123.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 123.</span>&mdash;Microscopic section of the normal endometrium, showing the utricular
glands extending into the muscular tissue (Beyea).</p></div>

<p>The length of time during which it is advisable to keep
the woman in bed depends upon the extent and nature
of the disease for which the curetting has been done.
As a general rule, the longer the stay in bed the better
it is for the woman. If the uterus is much enlarged or
if subinvolution is present, the patient should stay in bed
for two weeks. Such rest in the recumbent position
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
diminishes the congestion of the pelvic organs and is of
great aid in restoring the parts to a normal condition.
Careful attention should be paid to the regularity of the
bowels. Mild purgation with saline purgatives should be
continued during the convalescence. Daily massage,
started two or three days after the operation, will facilitate
the cure.</p>

<p>All the endometritial structures are never completely
removed by the curette. The distal ends of the utricular
glands, which penetrate the muscular coat of the uterus
(see <a href="#fig_123">Fig. 123</a>), remain after thorough and vigorous curetting.</p>

<p>After removing the endometrium with the curette the
cavity of the uterus does not become lined with a cicatricial
membrane, but a new endometrium is produced.
It is probable that the new membrane is developed from
the remains of the utricular glands. The new endometrium
grows in a very short time. In some cases it
has been sufficiently well formed to permit pregnancy
five weeks after curetting.</p>

<p>The first menstrual period, and sometimes the second
and third, after the operation of curetting may be missed.
As a general rule, the menstrual bleeding is much less
profuse than before the operation.</p>

<p>The therapeutic object of curetting for endometritis is
to replace the diseased endometrium by a new membrane
which has grown under conditions of rest and asepsis.</p>

<h4 id="EXFOLIATIVE_ENDOMETRITIS">EXFOLIATIVE ENDOMETRITIS, OR MEMBRANOUS DYSMENORRHEA.</h4>

<p>There is a disease which has been called membranous
dysmenorrhea or exfoliative endometritis, in which large
membranous pieces of the endometrium or a cast of the
whole structure is thrown off at the menstrual period
(see <a href="#fig_124">Fig. 124</a>). The condition is most often found in virgins
or sterile women. The membrane may be thrown
off at every menstrual period, or at periods separated by
intervals of various length.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_124" src="images/fig_124.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 124.</span>&mdash;Membrane discharged
in membranous dysmenorrhea.</p></div>

<p>The menstrual period is usually accompanied by intense
uterine pain, which may resemble labor-pain, and which
persists until the separation of
the endometrium. In some cases
of this disease menstruation is
very irregular.</p>

<p>The diagnosis is made from examination
of the characteristic
membrane that is discharged.
The condition should not be
confused with abortion, in which
the large irregular decidual cells
will be discovered. Some women
are very liable to early
menstrual miscarriage, and have
repeated accidents of this kind,
which in some cases have led the
physician to believe that the condition of exfoliative endometritis
was present.</p>

<p>The local treatment consists of dilatation and curetting
of the uterus, which operation it may be necessary
to repeat several times. Careful attention should be directed
toward re-establishing or maintaining the general
health.</p>

<h4 id="SENILE_ENDOMETRITIS">SENILE ENDOMETRITIS.</h4>

<p>This disease, also called post-climacteric endometritis,
occurs at any period after the menopause. There is a
thin seropurulent discharge from the uterus, often so profuse
as to soil the clothing. The quantity of the discharge
may be increased with a certain monthly periodicity.
The discharge is often streaked with blood, or is
brown colored from the presence of altered blood. There
may be occasional or even continuous slight hemorrhage
from the uterus. The discharge is usually fetid, and may
be exceedingly irritating to the vagina and vulva. The
objective symptoms often resemble in all respects the
symptoms of cancer of the body of the uterus.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>There is usually dull pain in the lower part of the
abdomen and the back; and if the disease continues for
sufficient time, there may appear symptoms indicative of
septic absorption&mdash;loss of appetite, emaciation, and
slight elevation of temperature.</p>

<p>The pathologic changes which take place in the
uterus in this disease have not been definitely determined.
It seems probable that in some cases the condition may
be produced, as in senile vaginitis, by infection of an
endometrium the integrity of which had been impaired
by the atrophic changes occurring after the menopause.
Microscopic examination of portions of the endometrium
removed by the curette shows the appearance of long-standing
chronic inflammation.</p>

<p>These cases are often mistaken for cancer of the body
of the uterus, and the diagnosis should always be immediately
made by microscopic examination of the material
removed by a thorough curetting of the whole of the
uterine cavity.</p>

<p>The treatment of senile endometritis consists of applications
to the endometrium of a solution of nitrate of silver,
from one-half to one dram to the ounce of water, or
of thorough curetting of the endometrium.

<h3 id="SUBINVOLUTION_OF_THE_UTERUS_SUPERINVOLUTION_OF_THE_UTERUS">SUBINVOLUTION OF THE UTERUS; SUPERINVOLUTION OF THE UTERUS.</h3>

<h4 id="SUBINVOLUTION_OF_THE_UTERUS">SUBINVOLUTION OF THE UTERUS.</h4>

<p>Subinvolution of the uterus is a condition that results
from imperfect involution of the uterus after labor, abortion,
or miscarriage. The muscular and fibrous structures
of the uterus, which had become hypertrophied
under the influence of pregnancy, fail to undergo properly
the retrograde changes of fatty degeneration and absorption
which normally occur after the expulsion of the
product of conception, and which are essential for the
restoration of the uterus to its normal size. The elements
of the endometrium and the vascular system of
the uterus also remain hypertrophied; consequently the
uterus is larger, heavier, more congested than normal.</p>

<p>Similar arrest of involution may occur coincidently in
the ligaments of the uterus, which are left larger, longer,
and more relaxed than in the normal condition.</p>

<p>The pathological changes that occur in the subinvoluted
uterus are similar to those found in chronic endometritis
and metritis, which have already been described.
In fact, chronic endometritis and metritis accompany
subinvolution from the beginning.</p>

<p>There are many causes of subinvolution of the uterus.
Too early rising from bed is a most frequent cause. This
is especially true after abortion or miscarriage; for many
women treat such occurrences as of but little moment,
and refuse to stay in bed for more than a few days.</p>

<p>Imperfect evacuation of the uterus after abortion or
miscarriage is a common cause. Laceration of the cervix,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
retrodisplacement of the uterus, and laceration of the
perineum are all causes of subinvolution of the uterus.</p>

<p>The symptoms of subinvolution are the same as those
already described under Chronic Metritis&mdash;backache,
headache, bearing-down pain in the pelvis, general physical
debility, leucorrhea, and menorrhagia.</p>

<p>The <b>treatment</b> of subinvolution should be directed
toward the relief of the primary cause of the condition.
Laceration of the perineum or of the cervix, retroversion,
or endometritis caused by retention of placental tissue
after miscarriage, should receive appropriate treatment.</p>

<p>Subinvolution may often be cured by the douches,
iodine applications, and depletion of the cervix spoken
of under the treatment of laceration of the cervix, provided
the primary cause is removed or corrected.</p>

<p>In any case the cure is always hastened by thorough
curetting of the uterus. This operation should always
be performed when the woman is etherized for the relief
of any other condition, as a laceration of the cervix or of
the perineum.</p>

<p>The cure of subinvolution depends a great deal upon
the time that has elapsed from the inception of the condition
to the institution of treatment. The secondary
changes in the endometrium and body of the uterus
resulting from chronic congestion and inflammation in
time becomes so established that the disease will not
yield to any treatment, even though the primary cause
of the trouble may be cured.</p>

<p>In obstinate chronic cases of subinvolution of the uterus
amputation of the cervix sometimes has a most
marked effect, and this operation should always be resorted
to whenever the disease has resisted the milder
treatment already prescribed. Amputation of the cervix
is sometimes followed by a transformation of all the tissues
of the uterus similar to that occurring in normal
involution after labor, and a striking diminution in the
size of the uterine body takes place. The amputation
of the cervix should always be accompanied by a thorough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
curetting. Sometimes the change in the body of
the uterus is so marked after amputation of the cervix,
or even after trachelorrhaphy, that a condition of superinvolution,
or uterine atrophy, results.</p>

<h4 id="SUPERINVOLUTION_OF_THE_UTERUS">SUPERINVOLUTION OF THE UTERUS.</h4>

<p>Superinvolution of the uterus is a disease the reverse
of subinvolution. In this condition the uterus, after
childbirth or abortion, not only undergoes the normal
involution, but continues to atrophy until the length of
the uterine cavity may measure but one and a half inches.
The atrophy involves the neck as well as the body of the
organ, the Fallopian tubes, and sometimes the ovaries.</p>

<p>Superinvolution of the uterus is a rare condition. The
cause is difficult to determine. It has been attributed to
great loss of blood at confinement, to prolonged lactation,
and to pelvic peritonitis occurring during the puerperium.</p>

<p>Amenorrhea is the most marked symptom of superinvolution.
Nervous disturbances and hysterical symptoms
may also be present.</p>

<p>The diagnosis is easily made from the history of the
case and by means of bimanual examination and the use
of the sound. Congenital malformation may be excluded
from the fact that a pregnancy has occurred, and senile
atrophy from a consideration of the age and history of
the woman. The treatment should be directed to restoring
and maintaining the general health of the woman.</p>

<p>Iron and the remedies useful in other forms of amenorrhea
may be of advantage.

<h3 id="CANCER_AND_SARCOMA_OF_THE_UTERUS">CANCER AND SARCOMA OF THE UTERUS.</h3>

<h4 id="CANCER_OF_THE_BODY_OF_THE_UTERUS">CANCER OF THE BODY OF THE UTERUS.</h4>

<p>Cancer of the body of the uterus is a rare disease in
comparison with cancer of the cervix. The older statistics&mdash;those
of Schroeder&mdash;appear to show that the disease
begins in the body of the uterus in about 2 per cent. of
all cases of cancer of this organ. This percentage, however,
is probably too small. Cancer of the body of the
uterus is by no means an infrequent disease; it is a disease
for which the physician should always be on the
watch.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_125" src="images/fig_125.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 125.</span>&mdash;Diffuse cancer of the endometrium.]
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p></div>

<p>Cancer of the body of the uterus originates in the epithelial
structures of the endometrium. It may first appear
on the surface of the endometrium or deeply in the
utricular glands.</p>

<p>The gross appearance of the disease varies as does
cancer of the cervix or of any other part of the body.</p>

<p>Cancer of the uterus may begin upon the surface of
the endometrium as a superficial ulceration, as a uniform
swelling of the mucous membrane, as a polypoid or papillary
projection, or as a large cauliflower-like mass projecting
into the uterine cavity.</p>

<p>When the disease begins in the utricular glands, it may
form nodules throughout the body of the uterus. These
nodules are of various sizes, from that of a pea to that of
a hen’s egg. They grow rapidly. They may be submucous
and project into the uterine cavity, or they may
project beneath the peritoneal covering, giving the uterus
an irregular nodular appearance (<a href="#fig_126">Fig. 126</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_126" src="images/fig_126.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 126.</span>&mdash;Nodular form of cancer of the body of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>In the later stages of the disease the whole body of
the uterus becomes infiltrated. The endometrium is
destroyed. The cancerous masses ulcerate and break
down. The peritoneal covering is for a certain time a
barrier to the extension of the disease. In many cases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
the whole of the body of the uterus may be infiltrated
with cancer, and yet the peritoneum will remain intact.
The accompanying illustration (<a href="#fig_127">Fig. 127</a>) shows this:
the infiltration extends to, but does not involve, the peritoneum.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_127" src="images/fig_127.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 127.</span>&mdash;Cancer of the body of the uterus: a large single cancerous nodule
(<i>c</i>) in the anterior wall has been divided.</p></div>

<p>Later, however, the peritoneum, the Fallopian tubes,
and the ovaries become involved. Intestinal adhesions
are formed, and the disease may extend throughout the
abdominal cavity. The cervix and the vagina may be
attacked by extension from above, though, on the other
hand, the disease may progress sufficiently to destroy
life, and yet the cervix may remain unaffected.</p>

<p>Metastasis may take place by way of the lymphatics.
Extension by metastasis, however, is unusual.</p>

<p>Cancer of the body of the uterus occurs at a somewhat
later age than cancer of the cervix. The average age is
between fifty and sixty. The disease attacks both the
parous and nulliparous woman, the latter perhaps more
often than the former.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>The causes of cancer of the body of the uterus are
unknown. It is probable that the various forms of endometritis,
by diminishing the resistance of the endometrium,
predispose to the development of cancer. It
has been maintained that fibroid tumors of the uterus, as
a result of the accompanying alterations in the endometrium,
predispose to cancer. Cancer of the endometrium
is certainly not infrequently found in uteri containing
fibroid tumors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_128" src="images/fig_128.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 128.</span>&mdash;Malignant adenoma of the body of the uterus (Beyea).</p></div>

<p><b id="MALIGNANT_ADENOMA">Malignant adenoma</b> is a disease of the utricular glands
which has been classed by some writers as a distinct disease,
by others as a form of carcinoma. In it the gland-spaces
are much enlarged, irregular, and joined to other
gland-spaces. The columnar epithelial cells often fill
the whole of the gland-space (<a href="#fig_128">Fig. 128</a>) The cells,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
however, never infiltrate the interstitial tissue, as in
cancer. The muscular wall of the uterus appears to be
destroyed by atrophy or by fatty degeneration.</p>

<p>The disease is malignant, it extends to the neighboring
structures, and it destroys life. It presents, in the later
stages, all the gross appearances and phenomena of
cancer.</p>

<p>The <b>symptoms</b> of cancer of the fundus are hemorrhage,
leucorrheal discharge, and pain.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_129" src="images/fig_129.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 129.</span>&mdash;Advanced malignant adenoma of the body of the uterus. A fibroid
tumor (<i>F</i>) is in the fundus.</p></div>

<p>In women before the time of the menopause the hemorrhage
may appear as a menorrhagia or a metrorrhagia,
as an increase of the normal menstrual bleeding, or as a
bleeding occurring at some other time than the normal
menstrual period. Such irregular bleeding may be caused
by any unusual effort.</p>

<p>After the menopause the hemorrhage may appear as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
return of menstruation, occurring with more or less
periodicity, and, as in cancer of the cervix, often contemplated
with satisfaction by the woman. It may appear
as a slight occasional discharge of blood, as a bloody
streak in the leucorrheal discharge, as a spot upon the
clothing, or as continuous hemorrhage. In the late
stages of the disease there is a continuous discharge of
blood.</p>

<p>The leucorrheal discharge at first resembles that of a
non-malignant endometritis. It often begins as a gradual
increase of a leucorrhea which the woman may have
had for several years. It may be streaked with blood.
In the early stages there is nothing at all characteristic
about the discharge; later, however, it usually becomes
very offensive, on account of the breaking down of
necrotic tissue. It becomes more purulent in character,
and brown in color from the presence of blood. In some
cases of cancer of the fundus, however, the leucorrheal
discharge remains light-colored and practically odorless
throughout the whole course of the disease. It is sometimes
thin and watery and exceedingly profuse, saturating
many napkins during the day.</p>

<p>The pain of cancer of the fundus is not a marked
symptom. It may be absent even though the whole
body of the uterus be involved by the disease. When
the peritoneum is affected, and extension takes place to
other pelvic structures, the pain is much more pronounced.
In other cases the pain may be present in the
early stages, before the disease has extended beyond the
endometrium.</p>

<p>The pain may be referred to the region of the uterus,
to the back, or sometimes to parts of the pelvis remote
from the uterus, as the crest of the ilium.</p>

<p>Bimanual examination shows a patulous external os,
cervical canal, and internal os. As has already been
said, this patulous condition is characteristic of gross
disease of the endometrium.</p>

<p>The body of the uterus is usually somewhat enlarged,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
tender on pressure between the vaginal finger and the
abdominal hand, and, in the late stages of the nodular
form of cancer, irregular in outline.</p>

<p>The causes of death in cancer of the fundus uteri are
the same as those that have already been considered in
cancer of the cervix. Extension to abdominal organs is,
however, more frequent in cancer of the fundus.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis.</b>&mdash;It is of the greatest importance to make
an early diagnosis of cancer of the fundus uteri, because,
of all parts of the body that may be attacked by malignant
disease, the fundus uteri offers the best prospect of
cure by operation. In the early stages the disease can
easily be completely removed.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage from the uterus is the universal symptom,
and should never be disregarded. The various manifestations
of hemorrhage in cancer of the fundus should
always be borne in mind, and should always prompt a
thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Leucorrheal discharge occurring at or after the menopause,
in a woman previously free from such discharge,
should also excite suspicion.</p>

<p>If a careful examination of the cervix fails to reveal
any cause for the hemorrhage or the discharge, the interior
of the uterus should be thoroughly examined by the
curette.</p>

<p>A patulous cervical canal and internal os are good indications
that there is some gross disease of the endometrium.
In cancer of the fundus the cervical canal and
the internal os are usually sufficiently open to permit
thorough curetting without further dilatation.</p>

<p>The Sims sharp curette may be used with safety if
ordinary care be observed. If the woman is nervous, an
anesthetic should be administered, though in most cases
diagnostic curetting gives but little pain and may be performed
without ether.</p>

<p>The operator should not be content with the removal
of a few strips or portions of the endometrium. He
should remember that in the early stages the disease may
be confined to a small area, and, unless the whole interior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
of the uterus is gone over, this area may be missed by
the curette, and only healthy endometrium may be removed
for examination. Such thorough curetting is of
especial importance in case the tissue removed should at
first present no suspicious features upon gross examination.
All portions of the endometrium should be saved
and preserved as directed in cancer of the cervix.</p>

<p>The tissue should be submitted for examination to a
person trained in gynecological pathology. The recognition
of the early stages of cancer of the endometrium,
and especially of malignant adenoma, requires the training
of the expert. If a positive diagnosis cannot be
given from the microscopic examination, the case should
be carefully watched, and if the symptoms continue,
subsequent curetting and microscopic examination should
be made.</p>

<p>The <b>treatment</b> of cancer of the fundus is immediate
complete hysterectomy, with removal of the tubes and
ovaries. Cancer has recurred in an ovary after removal
of the uterus. The hysterectomy may be performed by
the vaginal, the abdominal, or the combined method.</p>

<p>The ultimate results of hysterectomy for cancer of the
body of the uterus are exceedingly good. Statistics show
about 75 per cent. of permanent cures. Recurrence may
be considered exceptional. In this respect they are in
marked contrast to the results after operation for cancer
of the cervix.</p>

<h4 id="SARCOMA_OF_THE_UTERUS">SARCOMA OF THE UTERUS.</h4>

<p>Sarcoma of the uterus is a very rare disease. There
have been but few properly authenticated cases of this
disease reported in medical literature. All cases of this
disease should be put on record.</p>

<p>There are two varieties of sarcoma of the uterus: diffuse
sarcoma of the mucous membrane, and sarcoma of
the uterine parenchyma.</p>

<p>In <b id="DIFFUSE_SARCOMA_OF_THE_MUCOUS_MEMBRANE">diffuse sarcoma of the mucous membrane</b> the
endometrium is infiltrated by round or spindle cells.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
Soft projections or tumors, which may be villous, lobulated,
or polypoid in shape, are formed upon the mucous
membrane.</p>

<p>The polypoid sarcoma may present at the cervix uteri.
The disease extends to the muscular coat of the uterus.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_130" src="images/fig_130.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 130.</span>&mdash;Diffuse sarcoma of the mucous membrane of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>In the later stages ulceration and disintegration of tissue
occur.</p>

<p>The cervix is not involved by the disease.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i> of this form of sarcoma resemble those
of cancer of the fundus. There are hemorrhage, discharge,
and pain.</p>

<p>The discharge is serous, and is less fetid than in cancer,
as ulceration takes place later in the course of the disease.</p>

<p>The cervical canal is patulous, and in the polypoid
form the tumor may be felt projecting into the cavity of
the uterus or protruding from the external os.</p>

<p>The fundus uteri is enlarged and is tender upon pressure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
A positive diagnosis can be made only by microscopic
examination of curetted or excised tissue.</p>

<p><b id="SARCOMA_OF_THE_UTERINE_PARENCHYMA">Sarcoma of the uterine parenchyma</b>, or fibro-sarcoma,
or recurrent fibroid, begins in the muscular coat of
the uterus. It appears as nodules of various size, which
may be interstitial or confined to the muscular coat, submucous
or projecting beneath the mucous membrane, or
subperitoneal, projecting beneath the peritoneal coat.
On section these nodules are pale in appearance and soft
in consistency. They are rarely found in the cervix.
The submucous form of nodule may become polypoid,
project into the cavity of the uterus, and with comparative
frequency produce inversion of the uterus.</p>

<p>The nodules of sarcoma differ from those of benign
fibroid tumors in the fact that they have no capsule.
They cannot be enucleated, but are intimately connected
with the surrounding uterine tissue. Metastatic nodules
occur in the vagina, the peritoneum, and in other parts
of the body.</p>

<p>In the later stages of the disease the nodules disintegrate
and break down.</p>

<p>It is probable that fibro-sarcoma usually, if not always,
originates in a benign fibroid tumor. In the early stage
of the disease the microscopic appearances of fibroid
tumor are present, and the transition from the benign to
the malignant growth may be studied.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;The symptoms of this form of sarcoma
resemble at first those of fibroid tumor; they are&mdash;hemorrhage
in the form of menorrhagia; a serous, non-odorous
discharge; and a moderate degree of pain.</p>

<p>Later, when ulceration and disintegration take place,
the hemorrhage becomes more profuse and continuous.
The discharge becomes fetid, and contains broken-down
sarcomatous tissue. The pain becomes more severe.
The uterus is enlarged, and the nodular outline may be
determined by palpation.</p>

<p>Before metastasis has taken place the differential diagnosis
between sarcoma and benign fibroid tumor can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
made only by microscopic examination of the discharge
or of curetted or excised portions of tissue. The duration
of sarcoma of the uterus is about three years.</p>

<p>Sarcoma may occur at almost any age. Hysterectomy
has been performed for this disease in a girl of thirteen.
Several cases have been reported under twenty years of
age. The most usual period is about the time of the
menopause, in the decade from forty to fifty.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> of sarcoma of the uterus is immediate
complete hysterectomy. If in the early stage a positive
diagnosis cannot be made between benign fibroid and
sarcoma, the woman should not be exposed to the dangers
of waiting, but the uterus should be immediately
removed.</p>

<p><b id="CHORIO_EPITHELIOMA">Chorio-epithelioma</b> or <b>syncytioma malignum</b> is a
rare and peculiar malignant growth of the uterus which
occurs after pregnancy. It originates at the placental
site from the epithelial cells covering the chorionic villi.
It occurs during the course or after the termination of a
uterine or tubal pregnancy. In typical cases the disease
immediately follows labor at term, abortion, or a destroyed
extra-uterine pregnancy. It may, however, remain latent
for weeks or months.</p>

<p>The tumor may be a nodular or pedunculated outgrowth
attached to the uterine wall; a fungoid growth
from the endometrium; or an intramural growth covered
with endometrium. The tumor varies in size from that
of a cherry-stone to a mass several inches in diameter.
It is composed of soft fragile spongy tissue, light or dark
red in color, infiltrated with blood, and containing circumscribed
hemorrhages. Histologically the tumor consists
of many types of cells irregularly placed; syncytial
tissue, cells derived from Langhans’ layer, and sometimes
chorionic connective tissue. There are numerous
cavities containing blood and connective tissue.</p>

<p>Metastatic growths have a similar structure. Metastasis
takes place through the vascular system and may
reach distant organs&mdash;the lungs, liver, and spleen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;There is no characteristic symptom of
chorio-epithelioma. The chief symptom is irregular or
continuous hemorrhage from the uterus following a labor,
an abortion, or an extra-uterine pregnancy. The body
of the uterus is enlarged, and the cervical canal dilated
as in cancer and sarcoma. A positive diagnosis can be
made only by microscopic examination of tissue removed
by the curet.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;As the disease is exceedingly malignant
and of rapid growth, immediate hysterectomy is indicated.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3 id="FIBROID_TUMORS_OF_THE_UTERUS">FIBROID TUMORS OF THE UTERUS.</h3>

<p>Fibroid tumors originate in the muscular wall of the
uterus. They are composed of elements resembling, to
a greater or less extent, those that compose the middle
uterine wall. They consist of connective tissue and of
unstriped muscular tissue in varying proportions. Uterine
tumors composed exclusively of muscular fibres&mdash;true
myomata&mdash;very rarely occur.</p>

<p>A number of names, based upon the proportion of the
component elements, have been used by writers to designate
these tumors. They have been called fibroma, myoma,
myo-fibroma, and fibro-myoma. The natural history
of all the varieties is about the same, and varies but
little with the proportion of the elements. I shall therefore
consider them under the general name of fibroid
tumors of the uterus.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors of the uterus are benign, in the sense
that they do not, like cancer, infiltrate contiguous structures
or infect the general system.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors are loosely attached to the surrounding
uterine wall. They are usually invested by loose cellular
tissue, forming a capsule from which they may easily be
enucleated. Blood-vessels, usually of small size, connect
the tumor with its capsule. Dense adhesion between the
tumor and its capsule is the result of inflammatory
action. The loose connection of the fibroid tumor with
the surrounding structures explains the ease with which
these tumors travel and are squeezed out of the uterine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
wall. It will be remembered that in this respect the
fibroid differs from the nodule of cancer and of sarcoma.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_131" src="images/fig_131.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 131.</span>&mdash;Interstitial fibroid tumor of the uterus. A small submucous fibroid
appears in the uterine cavity.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_132" src="images/fig_132.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 132.</span>&mdash;Subperitoneal fibroid tumors of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>To the naked eye fibroid tumors present a white or
rosy appearance. The intensity of the red color is, as
a rule, proportional to the amount of muscular tissue.
On section the bundles of fibrous tissue, arranged more
or less concentrically about many axes, may be apparent.
The vessels in the tumor itself are usually small and few
in number. The large arteries and venous sinuses are
found in the capsule.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors vary in hardness from the soft myoma
to dense stony nodules composed almost entirely of fibroid
tissue.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors vary in size from the smallest nodule
in the uterine wall to a solid mass weighing one hundred
and forty pounds. The tumors that usually come under
observation weigh from one to ten pounds.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors occur most frequently in the body of
the uterus. As has already been mentioned, however,
they are sometimes found in the infra-vaginal portion of
the cervix, and a peculiarly dangerous form of fibroid
grows from the supra-vaginal cervix.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors are multiple in the great majority of
cases. It is unusual to find a single fibroid nodule or
tumor in the uterus. Sometimes one tumor far outgrows
the rest, but if the uterine wall is carefully examined
other small nodules will usually be found in its substance.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors originate in the muscular wall of the
uterus, and extend thence in various directions. When
they are situated in the muscular wall they are said to be
interstitial (<a href="#fig_131">Fig. 131</a>). When they grow outward, so that
they project beneath the peritoneum, they are called subperitoneal
(<a href="#fig_132">Fig. 132</a>). When they project into the uterine
cavity they are called submucous (see <a href="#fig_131">Fig. 131</a>).</p>

<p>When they grow from the side of the uterus, and especially
from the supra-vaginal portion of the cervix, and
extend outward into the cellular tissue between the folds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
of the broad ligaments, they are said to be intra-ligamentous
(<a href="#fig_133">Fig. 133</a>).</p>

<p><i>The subperitoneal fibroid</i> may continue to grow, pushing
the peritoneum ahead of it, until the tumor becomes
altogether extruded from the body of the uterus. It is
then attached to the uterus only by a pedicle of varying
thickness. The pedicle may be fibro-muscular in character,
or it may consist only of peritoneum, a little muscular
tissue, and blood-vessels.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_133" src="images/fig_133.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 133.</span>&mdash;Subperitoneal fibroids and an intra-ligamentous fibroid of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>Such a hard, freely movable tumor often causes a great
deal of peritoneal irritation. A serous fluid may be
thrown out by the peritoneum, and a moderate degree of
ascites may occur. Adhesions may be formed between
the fibroid tumor and contiguous structures&mdash;the abdominal
parietes, the omentum, or intestines. These adhesions
are often exceedingly extensive, firm, and vascular,
so that in some cases the tumor derives its chief blood-supply
and mechanical support from such adventitious
attachments. The uterine pedicle may, as a result of
progressive atrophy, traction, or violence from a fall, become
detached, and the tumor, having then lost all uterine
connection, appears to be a fibroid growth of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
omentum, intestine, or abdominal wall. This is the
origin of many so-called fibroid tumors of these structures.</p>

<p>Detachment from the uterus may also occur, as the
result of atrophy of the pedicle or of violence, in the
case of a pediculated subperitoneal fibroid that has not
contracted adhesions to other structures, and the tumor
will then be found free in the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p>The subperitoneal fibroid in its upward growth sometimes
drags the body of the uterus with it, and in this
way may produce great elongation and distortion of the
cervix.</p>

<p><i>The submucous fibroid</i> grows toward the uterine cavity.
It presses the mucous membrane before it, and it may
enter the cavity of the uterus, being altogether extruded
from the uterine wall. It then forms a pediculated tumor
lying in the uterus&mdash;an intra-uterine polyp. The pedicle
is composed of dense fibro-muscular tissue, and is invested
by a sheath of mucous membrane, unless this
structure has been destroyed. The pedicle may be but
slightly vascular, or it may rarely contain large arteries.
As a general rule, the greater the degree of the extrusion
of the polyp and the longer the pedicle, the less is the vascular
supply. Rapid spontaneous hemostasis occurs after
a fibroid polyp is cut from its pedicle, as a result of the
thickness of the arterial walls and the contractility of
the pedicle.</p>

<p>The intra-uterine polyp, from prolonged pressure, sometimes
acquires the shape of the uterine cavity.</p>

<p>Uterine contractions are excited by the presence of the
polyp, and the tumor may in time be expelled from the
uterus, enter the vagina, and protrude at the vulva.</p>

<p>Submucous fibroids form the most usual variety of
uterine polypi. In some cases the overlying mucous
membrane becomes much stretched and attenuated, and
may finally rupture or slough. The fibroid tumor may
then escape through the opening in the mucous membrane,
and, having been extruded altogether from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
uterine wall, may be expelled from the body by uterine
contractions.</p>

<p>The fibroid polyp, being exposed to septic influences
from the vagina, may become inflamed and suppurate; or
sloughing and disintegration may occur because of interference
with the blood-supply in the pedicle.</p>

<p><i>The intra-ligamentous fibroid</i> grows from the side of the
uterus or from the supra-vaginal cervix. It pushes apart
the peritoneal folds of the broad ligament, and grows between
them or beneath them. The tumor is thus outside
of the peritoneum. It may fill the whole pelvis
with a dense unyielding mass, pushing the uterus to the
pelvic wall, destroying anatomical relations, and exerting
most disastrous pressure upon blood-vessels, nerves,
ureters, and other pelvic structures.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as these tumors enlarge in an upward direction,
they carry with them overlying pelvic organs;
thus the ureter may be found passing over the top of a
tumor which, beginning as an intra-ligamentous pelvic
growth, has become abdominal.</p>

<p>In some cases the fibroid grows from the posterior aspect
of the supra-vaginal cervix, passes beneath the
bottom of Douglas’s pouch, pushes the peritoneum above
it, and becomes a retro-peritoneal tumor.</p>

<p>Again, it may grow from the anterior aspect of the cervix
in the vesico-uterine space, and as it extends upward
may push the vesico-uterine fold of peritoneum above it
and drag up the bladder, so that this viscus is sometimes
found spread out upon the anterior face of the tumor and
extending as high as the umbilicus.</p>

<p>As has already been said, fibroid tumors are usually
multiple, and if one of the terms designating the position
of the tumor as subperitoneal or intra-ligamentous is
used to describe any case, we understand that the chief
tumor-mass is of this character.</p>

<p>The fibroid polyp is more likely to be single than any
of the other varieties. In fact, the fibroid polyp is usually
single; that is, no other fibroid tumor can be detected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
in the body of the uterus. This is not always the case,
however, and sometimes the repeated expulsion of successive
fibroid polypi from the same woman renders it
probable that several nodules were simultaneously present
in the uterine wall.</p>

<p>As a rule, fibroid tumors of the uterus are of slow
growth. In some cases five, ten, or fifteen years may
elapse before the tumor attains the size of the fetal or the
adult head. Sometimes the tumor appears to be of limited
growth, and early attains its maximum size, or it
may not increase at all in size after its first discovery by
the woman; in other cases the tumor slowly but steadily
grows until, after a lapse of ten or twenty years, it fills
the whole of the abdominal cavity and renders the woman
helpless from weight and pressure; and, finally, in some
instances the tumor grows unlimitedly with the rapidity
characteristic of an ovarian cyst, and in one or two years
may crowd the woman out of existence. This rapid unlimited
growth is characteristic of tumors of the fibro-cystic
variety.</p>

<p>A fibroid tumor causes very marked changes in the
body of the uterus&mdash;the muscular coat and the endometrium.
The whole uterus becomes enlarged. The cavity
is increased in length, and the muscular wall becomes
often very much hypertrophied. This hypertrophy resembles
that occurring in pregnancy. Even small fibroid
tumors may produce this condition, which seems to depend
more upon the position than upon the size of the
growth. The interstitial and the submucous tumors are
accompanied by a greater degree of uterine hypertrophy
than accompanies the subperitoneal growths. In some
cases the uterus may be of normal size if the subperitoneal
growth has become pedunculated. The uterus may
appear to be uniformly enlarged to the size of the fourth
or fifth month of pregnancy, and when incised it will be
found to contain one or more interstitial or subperitoneal
tumors that have become encapsulated by it. When such
a case is subjected to celiotomy the resemblance of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
uterus to pregnancy is very striking. Between such a
smooth, uniformly enlarged uterus on the one hand, and
the irregular, distorted mass of subperitoneal fibroids on
the other, there are an infinite number of varieties. A
great increase in the vascular supply accompanies the hypertrophy
of the uterus. The ovarian and uterine arteries
and their branches become very much hypertrophied,
while the veins in the broad ligaments and the sinuses
in the capsule of the tumor become enormous.</p>

<p>The endometrium shares in the changes that take place
in the uterus. It is, of course, increased in area with
the increase of the uterine cavity. There may be atrophic
changes from pressure upon or tension of this membrane,
or various forms of endometritis may be present,
most usually the interstitial and the glandular. The
glandular form of the disease is said to occur most frequently
when the tumor is remote from the cavity of the
uterus, as in the subperitoneal variety; while interstitial
endometritis occurs with the submucous and the interstitial
tumors.</p>

<p>In the Fallopian tubes and the ovaries pathological
changes occur as the result of uterine fibroids. The
tubes may present any of the forms of cystic change&mdash;hydrosalpinx,
pyosalpinx, or hematosalpinx&mdash;that are
caused by salpingitis. It is probable that these diseases
are often caused by extension of endometritis. The tubes
and ovaries may be much distorted and displaced from
the normal position. In some cases the ovary is drawn
out into a long cord five inches in length; in other cases
it is spread out upon the face of the tumor.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors are liable to several forms of degeneration&mdash;calcareous,
fatty, myxomatous, edematous, cystic,
telangiectatic, gangrenous or suppurative, necrobiotic,
and malignant.</p>

<p><i>Calcareous change</i>, from the deposit of lime-salts in
the fibroid nodules, is an unusual occurrence. It appears
most often in women beyond the menopause, and is part
of the atrophic changes that take place at this time. (It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
has occurred in a woman who had been subjected to
oöphorectomy for the relief of a fibroid tumor.)</p>

<p>I have seen a fibroid tumor the size of the adult head&mdash;a
solid calcareous mass which could be divided only
by means of a saw.</p>

<p>The calcareous nodules are surrounded by uterine tissue
to which they are but loosely attached. They may be
forced out of the uterus and escape at the vulva. They
have been called “womb-stones.”</p>

<p><i>Fatty degeneration</i> is a very unusual condition. It has
been assumed to take place, as a step preliminary to absorption,
in those cases in which a fibroid tumor disappears
after labor or from other cause.</p>

<p><i>Myxomatous degeneration</i> is also rare. In it an effusion
of mucous fluid takes place between the bundles of fibrous
tissue. Sometimes large cavities are formed in this way.</p>

<p>In the <i>edematous fibroid</i> the whole tumor is permeated
by a serous fluid. This condition is not unusual. It
resembles edema in any other part of the body. It is
often found in young women before the thirtieth year.</p>

<p><i>Cystic degeneration</i> of fibroid tumors may result from
any of the forms of degeneration with softening in which
cystic cavities are formed.</p>

<p>In some cases <i>fibro-cystic tumors</i> are caused by dilatation
of the lymphatics. They have been called “lymphangiectatic
fibroids.” An endothelial lining has occasionally
been found in the cystic cavities of these tumors.
The fluid removed from the cyst-cavities coagulates spontaneously.
Such fibroids have frequently been mistaken
for ovarian cysts.</p>

<p>In the <i>telangiectatic</i> or the <i>cavernous</i> form of fibroid
tumor there is an enormous dilatation of the vessels in
the new growth. The venous spaces are sometimes as
large as a walnut, and are filled with clotted or fluid
blood. This change usually affects one part, and not all,
of the tumor, which presents the gross appearance of a
sponge soaked with blood.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p><i>Gangrene</i> is most liable to occur in the fibroid polyp.
During the process of expulsion from the uterus the vascular
supply through the pedicle becomes impeded, so
that there is not sufficient blood for nutrition. The
tumor is exposed to septic infection through the vagina
and the cervix, and sloughing and suppuration occur. As
a result of such disintegration the tumor may be discharged
piecemeal.</p>

<p><i>Inflammation</i>, and occasionally <i>suppuration</i>, of fibroid
tumors remote from the cavity of the uterus may occur
from infection through the intestinal tract or other
channel.</p>

<p><i>Necrobiosis</i> occurs if the nutrition of the fibroid is cut
off and there is no infection of the dead tissue. The
tumor becomes soft, undergoes fatty degeneration, and
liquefies. The necrobiotic degeneration may involve
only part or all of the tumor. There is always danger
of septic infection occurring in this form of degeneration.</p>

<p><i>Sarcoma</i> may develop in a fibroid tumor of the uterus.
As has already been stated, the “circumscribed fibroid
sarcoma,” or sarcoma of the uterine parenchyma, is
thought by some authorities always to originate from
degeneration of a benign fibroid tumor. It seems probable
that the fibroid tumor predisposes the woman to the
development of sarcoma of the uterus.</p>

<p>Cancer may also occur in the endometrium of a fibroid
uterus. This occurrence is by no means an unusual one.
We cannot yet say positively that the fibroid favors the
development of cancer, but it seems probable that the
diseased endometrium that accompanies fibroids furnishes
a place of diminished resistance for the development of
malignant disease.</p>

<p>Martin has made an interesting analysis of 205 cases
of fibroid tumor of the uterus that had been submitted to
operation. From this analysis we may form some estimation
of the frequency of the various forms of degeneration
that have been described.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>Fatty degeneration existed in 7 cases. Calcification was
present in 3 cases. In 10 cases there was suppuration,
and this process was found in the submucous, interstitial,
and subperitoneal tumors. In 11 cases there was extensive
edema of the fibroid. In 8 cases the tumors had
become cystic.</p>

<p>The telangiectatic change was found to a marked degree
in 3 cases.</p>

<p>Sarcomatous degeneration had occurred in 6 cases.</p>

<p>In 7 cases the fibroid was complicated with cancer of
the fundus uteri, and in 2 cases with cancer of the neck
of the womb.</p>

<p>The fatty and calcareous changes are not to be considered
dangerous forms of degeneration.</p>

<p>The other changes, however, are often attended with
great danger to life. The dangers of suppuration and of
sarcomatous degeneration are obvious. The edematous
fibroid is often of rapid and unlimited growth, and is usually
accompanied by profuse hemorrhages from the uterus.
The cystic fibroid may grow as rapidly and as large as an
ovarian cyst. The telangiectatic tumors grow to large
size and are attended by the dangers of thrombosis and
embolism.</p>

<p>Cancer of the fundus with fibroid tumor may only be
a coincidence, and we will not assume that predisposition
to cancer is caused by the fibroid.</p>

<p>The statistics that have been given, however, show
that in at least 38 cases out of 205, or in about 18 per
cent. of the cases, changes took place in the fibroid that
seriously endangered the life of the woman.</p>

<p>Sterility, abortion, and difficult or impossible labor are
caused by uterine fibroids. Conception is impeded on
account of the displaced, distorted uterus and the hemorrhage
and discharge. Abortion is likely to occur, on
account of the endometritis and the unequal expansibility
and the irritability of the uterus.</p>

<p>Labor is sometimes rendered impossible by the presence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
of a uterine fibroid that obstructs the pelvis, and
Cesarean section has been performed for this cause.</p>

<p>The cause of fibroid tumor of the uterus is unknown.
Some authorities consider the condition, or at least the
predisposition to the condition, to be congenital. Uterine
fibroids have been observed in girls near the age of
puberty, and hysterectomy for fibroid has been performed
at the age of eighteen.</p>

<p>Usually the disease begins to cause symptoms, and first
comes under the observation of the physician, after the
thirtieth year. It is very probable that small interstitial
or subperitoneal fibroids exist in many women before this
period, but, on account of the small size and the position
of the growths, they produce no marked symptoms, and
if the woman bears children, the tumors are very likely
absorbed during the process of uterine involution.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors occur in both the white and the black
races&mdash;with somewhat greater frequency in the latter
than in the former. Tait says that fibroid tumors of the
uterus are unknown among the black women of Africa.
The disease is certainly very common among their descendants
in this country.</p>

<p>The frequency of uterine fibroids is difficult to determine,
for there are many cases in which the disease is
unrecognized on account of the small size of the tumor
and the absence of symptoms. It is, however, one of
the commonest diseases with which women suffer. In
a series of 504 celiotomies performed for diseases of
women at the University and Gynecean Hospitals, uterine
fibroids were found in 85, or in about 17 per cent. of
the cases.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors are found both in multiparous and in
nulliparous women&mdash;much more frequently in the latter
than in the former. Single women and sterile married
women are especially predisposed to this disease. There
are two probable causes for this difference. The unceasing
congestions of menstruation favor the development
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
of the neoplasm; and, when once started, its further
growth is not checked by the retrograde changes that
accompany involution of the uterus, and that sometimes
cause the disappearance of even large fibroids.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors are essentially growths of the menstrual
life of the woman. They usually first appear after
the thirtieth year, and they continue to grow until the
menopause. The size of the tumor and the severity of
all the symptoms progressively increase during the active
sexual period of life. It is very unusual for favorable
retrograde changes or permanent amelioration of symptoms
to occur during this period. In a woman with
fibroid tumor of the uterus the menopause is delayed for
five to fifteen years beyond the normal time. This is an
important fact to be remembered in connection with the
prognosis and the treatment of any case.</p>

<p>At the menopause, in the majority of cases, the growth
of the tumor is arrested, and the retrograde changes that
affect the genital apparatus involve also the fibroid tumor,
and atrophy of the neoplasm, with marked diminution in
size, and in some cases its complete disappearance, may
take place. The tumor becomes quiescent, and the
woman may finish her life in comparative comfort. This,
however, is by no means always the case. The fibroid
sometimes continues to grow after the menopause, and
the suffering is sometimes so unbearable that the woman
is finally driven to operation.</p>

<p>In some cases the tumor has developed entirely after
the menopause has been reached.</p>

<p>At each menstrual period there is usually a decided increase
in the size of the tumor and in the severity of the
symptoms. And at these periods, in the case of a submucous
or an interstitial fibroid, the cervical canal becomes
more patulous.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;The chief symptom of fibroid tumor of
the uterus is <i>hemorrhage</i>. This symptom is present in
the great majority of fibroids of all kinds. It is not,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
however, universally present. I have removed tumors
the size of the adult head, composed of interstitial and
subperitoneal fibroids, from women who had never suffered
with even slight menorrhagia. The hemorrhage
appears in the form of menorrhagia or metrorrhagia. It
may be an increase in the regular menstrual bleeding.
It may appear as a periodical bleeding occurring every
two weeks&mdash;a phenomenon that occurs in other diseases
of the uterus and the endometrium. It may appear as a
show of blood or a slight hemorrhage, after unwonted
effort, between the regular menstrual periods. This may
occur after straining at stool, coitus, or even emotional
disturbance. And, finally, it may appear as a continuous
bleeding from the uterus.</p>

<p>The cause of these hemorrhages is to be found in the
increased area of the endometrium accompanying the
uterine enlargement, and in the diseased condition of the
endometrium.</p>

<p>The hemorrhage is not usually alarming in amount,
and it may be somewhat controlled by rest in bed and the
administration of ergot or other drugs. In some cases,
however, it produces the most profound anemia, and in
others, especially in the uterine polyp, the woman may
literally bleed to death.</p>

<p>The symptom of hemorrhage is independent of the size
of the tumor, but depends upon the position of the
fibroid. As a rule, the hemorrhage is most severe with
the uterine polyp, less severe with the submucous and
the interstitial tumors, and least with the subperitoneal
variety. In some cases, when the mucous membrane
overlying a submucous tumor ruptures, the hemorrhage
may come directly from venous sinuses in the capsule.</p>

<p>The hemorrhage also depends upon the variety of the
growth. The edematous fibroid and the soft myoma appear
always to be accompanied by profuse bleeding. In
some cases the hemorrhage may occur periodically or
continuously in old women who have passed the menopause,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
and in whom there had been no bleeding for
several years. This has been observed in the small submucous
fibroids which, after a period of quiescence, have
gradually become polypoid, or which have undergone
suppuration and disintegration. The hemorrhage, the
offensive odor of the discharge, and the age and the
history of the patient are very likely to lead to the diagnosis
of cancer.</p>

<p>The blood that escapes from the fibroid uterus may be
fluid or clotted, or it may be partly decomposed from the
retention of clots.</p>

<p><i>A profuse secretion</i> from the utricular glands often
occurs between the uterine hemorrhages. This secretion
is usually thin and watery in character, and may be so
profuse as to require the continuous wearing of a napkin.
In some unusual cases there is no marked hemorrhage,
but a continuous abundant watery discharge.</p>

<p><i>Pain</i> is a more or less constant accompaniment of
fibroid tumors. It varies a great deal in character and
position. It is often referred to the sacrum and to the
top of the head or the occiput. Pain of this character
is due to the accompanying metritis and endometritis.
That it is uterine in origin is shown by the fact of its
complete and permanent disappearance from the day that
hysterectomy is performed.</p>

<p>The pain is always increased at the menstrual periods,
and may at first be present only at these times. It afterwards
becomes continuous.</p>

<p>In the case of a submucous or a polypoid fibroid there
may be present the pain of uterine contractions, referred
to the center of the lower abdomen, and resembling
labor-pains.</p>

<p>The pain from pressure is sometimes intense. It occurs
in large tumors and in those of pelvic growth, like the
intra-ligamentous fibroids. Sciatic or crural neuralgia
may be thus developed.</p>

<p>In all these cases there is a feeling of weight and dragging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
in the pelvis which is most marked in the erect position,
and which is caused by the weight of the tumor
and of the enlarged uterus.</p>

<p>The symptoms of pressure are very marked in the case
of intra-ligamentous tumors. The capacity of the bladder
may be so diminished that there may be continuous incontinence
of urine; or the bladder and the urethra may
be so distorted, from traction and pressure, that urine is
voided with great difficulty, and it is sometimes impossible
to introduce the catheter. I have seen a woman
with a fibroid the size of the adult head who could urinate
only when upon her hands and knees.</p>

<p>Pressure upon the pelvic nerves may, as has already
been mentioned, produce great pain, and in some cases
paralysis. Women are sometimes affected with sudden
complete paralysis of one or both legs from the pressure
of a fibroid. I have performed hysterectomy upon a
woman who had on several occasions fallen helpless in
the street from paralysis of the left leg caused by the pressure
of a small intra-ligamentous fibroid tumor. All the
pressure-symptoms are exaggerated at the menstrual
period, on account of the swelling of the tumor that
occurs at this time.</p>

<p>Pressure upon the rectum is often very marked, and
may cause constipation and hemorrhoids. Pressure upon
the ureters causes dilatation, hydronephrosis, and uremia.
This is a not infrequent cause of death, both in
the untreated case and after operation for the relief of
fibroids.</p>

<p>The effect of fibroid tumors of large size upon the heart
and blood-vessels has been remarked by several writers.
Fatty degeneration and brown atrophy have been found
associated with uterine fibroids in a number of instances.
This is undoubtedly the explanation of some cases of
death after operation.</p>

<p>Martin has called attention to the disposition to thrombosis
and embolism which seems to be especially marked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
in the telangiectatic form of tumor. This also explains
some of the cases of sudden death that occur after operation.
Operators have observed cases of sudden death,
probably from embolism, occurring sometimes several
weeks after hysterectomy for fibroid tumor.</p>

<p>The <b>diagnosis</b> of uterine fibroids is made from a study
of the symptoms already described and from the physical
examination.</p>

<p>If the tumor is large enough to be palpated through
the abdominal wall, the hard consistency and the irregular
bossed outline of the multinodular form of fibroid may
be detected.</p>

<p>By bimanual examination we determine the general
enlargement, and perhaps the irregular outline, of the
uterus. Sometimes, when the fibroid is small and interstitial,
a slight elevation, or perhaps merely a local induration,
may be felt. By grasping the cervix with a
tenaculum and drawing it down while the palpating finger
is in the rectum the whole of the posterior face of the
uterus may be explored and small fibroid nodules discovered.</p>

<p>The tumors are found to be continuous with the uterus
and movable with it. If the tumor is sufficiently large to
be grasped by an assistant, who draws it up or to either side,
it will be found that the motion is communicated to the
vaginal cervix. The cervix is often very hard, and may
have been dragged upward to such an extent that it cannot
be reached by the vaginal finger; or it may project
from the rounded surface of the tumor like the nipple on
the breast.</p>

<p>The hard, non-fluctuating character of the tumor may
usually be determined by bimanual examination. A sensation
resembling that of fluctuation may be elicited in
the edematous fibroid, and true fluctuation is, of course,
present in the cystic variety.</p>

<p>The uterine sound shows the increased length and the
irregularity of the uterine cavity. The sound is not often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
necessary for diagnosis. It is useful, however, in the case
of small interstitial fibroids. It will be remembered that
uterine enlargement is one of the most usual symptoms
of fibroid tumor.</p>

<p>The presence in the wall of the uterus of a hard nodule
or of an area of induration, with a decided increase in the
length of the uterine cavity (three to four inches), is strong
evidence of fibroid tumor.</p>

<p>Those fibroid tumors which cause symmetrical uterine
hypertrophy without any irregularity of surface are sometimes
difficult of diagnosis. They have been mistaken
for the pregnant uterus. The reverse mistake has also
very frequently been made, and the woman has been subjected
to celiotomy for fibroid tumor when a normal pregnancy
alone was present. The differential diagnosis between
fibroid and pregnancy is usually not difficult. In
making such a differential diagnosis it must be remembered
that in some cases of pregnancy the menstrual periods
continue during the early months or throughout the
course of pregnancy, and that irregular bleeding may
occur during pregnancy; also, on the other hand, that
the symptoms of menorrhagia and metrorrhagia may be
absent in the case of fibroid tumors. Mammary changes,
nausea, and pigmentation of the skin may occur with
fibroid tumors as with other diseases of the uterus or
the ovaries, and resemble the similar phenomena of pregnancy.
The bluish discoloration of the ostium vaginæ,
the soft cervix, the pulsation of the vaginal vessels, the
movements of the child, and the fetal heart-sounds are
absent in fibroid tumors. The recent history of the
tumor and its typical increase in size are observed in
pregnancy.</p>

<p>In the event of doubt the case should be watched for
a few months until the diagnosis becomes clear. Fibroid
tumors are of slow growth, and such delay is usually not
dangerous.</p>

<p>If the fibroid tumor is complicated with pregnancy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
the diagnosis becomes more difficult. This complication
is not an unusual one, and should always be borne
in mind.</p>

<p>The differential diagnosis between uterine fibroid and
ovarian cyst is easy except in the case of the fibro-cystic
tumor. Such tumors have very often been mistaken for
ovarian cysts. The mistake is not at all serious, as celiotomy
is indicated in either case. The operator, however,
should always determine the nature of the tumor
before proceeding with the operation after the abdomen
has been opened, as puncture of a fibro-cystic tumor may
be attended by alarming hemorrhage.</p>

<p>A small fibroid in the posterior wall of the uterus has
often been mistaken for retroflexion, and the woman has
been treated with a pessary. This mistake may be
avoided by feeling, with the abdominal hand, the fundus
uteri in its normal forward position, or by determining
the true direction of the uterus with the uterine sound.</p>

<p>The <b>prognosis</b> of uterine fibroids may be determined
from a consideration of the natural history, the degenerations,
and the complications of these neoplasms, which
have already been described.</p>

<p>Fibroid tumors are benign growths, in contradistinction
to cancer and sarcoma. They do not infiltrate contiguous
structures or invade the general system; but they are
not benign in the sense that they are not dangerous to
life.</p>

<p>As has been said, the disease may terminate as a uterine
polyp, which may be discharged from the body. But
during this process the woman may die from hemorrhage
or from septic absorption from the sloughing, disintegrating
tumor.</p>

<p>Some unusual fibroids give no trouble whatever, never
attain a large size, and are discovered only accidentally
during the life of the woman or at the autopsy.</p>

<p>In very exceptional cases&mdash;so rare that they are to be
looked upon as medical curiosities&mdash;the fibroid disappears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
spontaneously even after it has reached a large size.
This has occurred as the result of an accident, exploratory
celiotomy, and pregnancy.</p>

<p>We have no right in any case, however, to look for
such favorable termination.</p>

<p>The accidents that may happen to the tumor itself, and
which imperil the life of the woman, are various and
occur frequently. The dangerous forms of degeneration&mdash;the
edematous, the cystic, the telangiectatic, and the
sarcomatous&mdash;occur with sufficient frequency always to
be dreaded; and, even though these dangers be avoided,
the anemia from the continual hemorrhage exposes the
woman to fatal results from the diseases and accidents of
daily life. The most favorable course that we have a
right to expect, in any case of fibroid tumor of the uterus
that is not discharged as a uterine polyp, is that it will
grow slowly, that it will produce symptoms not unendurable,
and that at the menopause it will cease to grow
and will atrophy or disappear.</p>

<p>This comparatively favorable course condemns the
woman to a life of invalidism, more or less marked, during
the years that should be the most useful and active
of her existence. The menopause may be delayed for
five, ten, or fifteen years, or it may be indefinitely postponed;
and even after the menopause has occurred, in a
certain number of cases the fibroid, contrary to the usual
rule, continues to grow, and may ultimately cause death.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Fibroid Tumors of the Uterus.</b>&mdash;Operative
treatment is usually demanded in the case of
fibroid tumors. A few years ago the treatment usually
advised was palliative and expectant. The imperfect
technique rendered operations for this disease so fatal
that it was considered safest for the woman to allow the
tumor to pursue its natural course, hoping that, if small
and single, it would be discharged as a polyp, or that it
would grow slowly and would atrophy at the menopause,
the physician meanwhile relieving as much as possible,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
by palliative treatment, the symptoms that presented before
this favorable termination.</p>

<p>Many women, following this advice, have suffered
through the years of active life, and have finally found
relief and cure when the menopause was reached; others
have started upon this dreary course, and have died from
some of the accidents incident to these tumors; still
others have passed through these years of suffering, and
then have found the hoped-for goal vanished, the menopause
indefinitely postponed, or the tumor continuing to
grow after this period had been reached.</p>

<p>Many of these women are driven to the operating-table
to-day, after lives that have been wasted by this expectant
plan of treatment.</p>

<p>The great majority of fibroid tumors of the uterus
demand immediate operation. The operative technique
has been so perfected that the mortality after operation is
very small. The danger of operation is much less than
the dangers to which the woman is exposed from the
various accidents that are liable in this disease.</p>

<p>There are some cases, however, in which immediate
operation is not demanded. In a young woman with a
fibroid tumor of small size that is not causing serious
symptoms operation may be deferred and the case may
be watched. This plan is especially desirable if the
woman is anxious to have children. She should be told,
however, that conception is less likely to occur than in
the well woman, that she is liable to abort, and that the
tumor will grow more rapidly during her pregnancy.
On the other hand, there is the possibility of its disappearance
after labor.</p>

<p>If the tumor, even though small, is intra-ligamentous
and of pelvic growth, the expectant plan of treatment is
not justifiable. Dangerous pressure-symptoms are too
imminent, and if pregnancy occurs labor will be obstructed.
If the woman has reached the menopause, if
menstruation has ceased, and the tumor is causing no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
serious symptoms from its size and position, the case may
be watched with the hope that the disease will shortly
become quiescent. Such cases are exceptional. Usually
the tumor produces symptoms that render the woman
more or less of an invalid, and she should not be condemned
to this suffering and to the dangers of waiting.
In these cases we must not rely altogether upon the statement
of the woman in regard to the suffering caused by
the tumor. A woman, dreading operation, will often
underrate her suffering, or she will consider as normal
the disturbances to which she has, through a long period
of years, gradually become accustomed.</p>

<p>No drug has been discovered that has any influence
upon the growth of the fibroid tumor.</p>

<p>The most serious symptom, hemorrhage, may be alleviated
in a variety of ways. Rest in the recumbent posture,
to relieve congestion, is most important. Such rest
is especially demanded at the menstrual period. Pressure-symptoms
and pain are likewise relieved by rest.
Careful attention to the regularity of the bowels is desirable.
The administration of saline purgatives to the
extent of mild purgation depletes the pelvic circulation,
and is especially useful immediately before a menstrual
period. Coitus should be avoided immediately before
and during the menstrual period.</p>

<p>Ergot, gallic acid, hydrastis, bromide of potash, and
erigeron are useful to control the bleeding. They should
be administered in frequently repeated doses for a long
period.</p>

<p>Thorough curetting of the cavity of the uterus is the
most certain method of controlling the hemorrhage. By
this procedure the diseased endometrium is removed, and
the bleeding is usually very decidedly diminished for several
months afterwards.</p>

<p>The treatment by electricity, once popular with some
physicians, has not stood the test of time and experience.
It does not stop the growth of the tumor. It has caused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
many deaths. It may produce peritoneal adhesions,
which render subsequent operation most difficult.</p>

<p>Ligature of the arteries supplying the uterus has been
performed with the object of arresting the growth of a
uterine fibroid. The results of this operation, however,
have not been satisfactory.</p>

<p><i>Salpingo-oöphorectomy</i> has been practised for a number
of years, and a large number of fibroid tumors have been
cured by it. Before the present perfected technique of
hysterectomy had been developed salpingo-oöphorectomy
was much the safer operation, and was always practised
whenever possible.</p>

<p>The object of the operation is to cause arrest of growth
and atrophy of the tumor by stopping menstruation and
producing a premature menopause.</p>

<p>According to the statistics of Tait, the operation results
in cure of the fibroid in 95 per cent. of the cases.</p>

<p>In some cases the bleeding stops immediately and never
recurs; in other cases the bleeding continues, in steadily
diminishing amount, for several weeks or a few months
after the operation; and finally, in a small proportion of
the cases, the bleeding is not arrested at all.</p>

<p>The atrophy of the tumor after this operation is also
variable. Sometimes the atrophy begins immediately,
and in a few weeks after the operation has proceeded to
a very marked degree, the tumor disappearing or being so
small as to give no trouble; in other cases the atrophy
is much slower; sometimes there is no arrest of growth
whatever.</p>

<p>The operation seems to produce most benefit in cases
of the hard fibroid. The edematous fibroid is often unaffected
by it; and it is not applicable in the case of fibro-cystic
tumors, which continue in unabated growth.</p>

<p>In performing the operation it is important that every
portion of ovarian tissue should be removed, and that the
Fallopian tube should be amputated as closely as possible
to the uterine cornu. Many cases of failure of this operation
are due to neglect of these precautions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>A very small portion of ovarian tissue may be sufficient
to continue menstruation.</p>

<p>A good many women who had derived no benefit from
the first operation have been subjected to a second operation,
a small remaining portion of the ovary being removed
or the stump of the Fallopian tube being excised,
complete cure resulting.</p>

<p>The nature of the influence of the Fallopian tube in
this matter is not understood. Tait lays especial stress
upon the necessity of its complete removal.</p>

<p>The importance of the removal of the tubes may be
realized from Tait’s statement that “removal of the ovaries
alone is followed by immediate and complete arrest
of menstruation in about 50 per cent. of the cases. Removal
of both tubes, with or without the ovaries, is followed
by the same arrest in about 90 per cent. of the
cases.” From this statement it appears that if one wishes
to stop menstruation, removal of the tubes is of even
more importance than removal of the ovaries.</p>

<p>The operation of salpingo-oöphorectomy is not advisable
in some cases, and in some others it is impossible to
perform it.</p>

<p>As has already been said, the operation is likely to fail
in the soft edematous fibroids. It should not be advised
in the fibro-cystic tumors. It is not advisable in the case
of large fibroid tumors of abdominal growth, because,
even though atrophy occur, it will be slow, and the symptoms
referable to the large hard tumor in the abdomen
will be but slowly relieved.</p>

<p>The operation is not applicable to the intra-ligamentous
fibroid of pelvic growth, producing urgent pressure-symptoms
that demand certain and immediate relief. In
the case of profuse exhausting hemorrhage, when the
anemia is so great that immediate and certain arrest of
bleeding is required, salpingo-oöphorectomy should not
be practised.</p>

<p>If the woman has reached the menopause, and, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
the cessation of menstruation, the tumor
continues to grow, salpingo-oöphorectomy will do no
good.</p>

<p>In some cases the tubes and ovaries cannot be removed.
They often occupy a position behind or under the tumor,
so that they cannot be removed without first taking the
tumor away. The tube and ovary may be so distorted
that only partial excision is possible, and this will result
in no benefit; or the tube and ovary may be spread out
upon the face of the tumor, incorporated with its capsule,
so that removal is impossible, and any attempt at removal
may result in rupture or penetration of large venous
sinuses&mdash;a most dangerous accident.</p>

<p>The operator should therefore never undertake the
operation of salpingo-oöphorectomy for uterine fibroid
unless he is prepared to perform hysterectomy if this
operation is found necessary.</p>

<p><i>Hysterectomy</i> is deservedly the favorite operation for
uterine fibroids at the present day.</p>

<p>The danger of the operation is small, being but little,
if any, greater than that attending salpingo-oöphorectomy
for fibroids, if we compare only those cases in which
either operation may be performed.</p>

<p>The operation is applicable to every kind of fibroid
tumor. The relief of symptoms is immediate and certain.</p>

<p>The reflex symptoms, such as backache and headache,
which are directly due to the pathological condition of
the uterus, often disappear immediately and permanently.
This cannot be said of salpingo-oöphorectomy, after
which operation these symptoms often continue for an
indefinite period.</p>

<p>The treatment of uterine fibroids has followed in development
the growth of abdominal and pelvic surgery.
In the days when celiotomy was a dangerous operation
the palliative treatment was advisable. When salpingo-oöphorectomy
could be safely performed this treatment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
was practised; and now that hysterectomy is equally safe,
it has become the operation of election.</p>

<p>The details of the operation of hysterectomy for
uterine fibroids will be considered in a subsequent
chapter.</p>

<p><i>Myomectomy (Abdominal).</i>&mdash;In some cases of uterine
fibroid it is possible to remove the tumor without taking
away the uterus. This operation, when performed
through an abdominal incision, is called abdominal
myomectomy. From a surgical standpoint it is the ideal
plan of treatment, as the woman is cured of the disease
without suffering mutilation.</p>

<p>Myomectomy is especially adapted to the treatment of
single fibroid tumors which may be excised or shelled
out of the body of the uterus. It is indicated in the
case of young women who are anxious for children.</p>

<p>The field of myomectomy is at present a limited one.
Single subperitoneal and interstitial fibroid tumors are
rare. Even though the secondary nodules may be small
at the time of operation, they will grow after the removal
of the chief mass. Hysterectomy has been required at a
second operation in a woman on whom myomectomy had
been first performed.</p>

<p>The operation is still on trial: its limitations and
remote results have not yet been determined. It should
be performed only by the experienced abdominal surgeon.
Many fatal cases of post-operative hemorrhage and of
sepsis have occurred. Though successful cases have
been reported by men of unusual skill and experience, in
which large numbers of uterine fibroids have been removed
from the uterus at one operation, yet these cases
must be looked upon as rare surgical triumphs which it
is to be hoped will become more frequent in the future.</p>

<p>On the ground of safety, hysterectomy is to be preferred
to myomectomy.</p>

<p>The details of the operation of myomectomy are
described in a subsequent chapter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<p>When the fibroid tumor is complicated by pregnancy
it may be necessary to perform Cesarean section, followed
by hysterectomy. This is not justifiable, however, unless
the fibroid is so situated that the passage of the child
by the natural way is impossible. The fibroid usually
increases more rapidly in size during pregnancy, but may
diminish a good deal with the involution of the uterus.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 134.</span>&mdash;Fibroid polyp producing partial inversion of the uterus.</p></div>

<p><i>Treatment of the Fibroid Polyp.</i>&mdash;When the fibroid
tumor is polypoid, and projects into the uterine cavity, or
the cervix, or beyond the external os, none of the operations
that have just been described are required. The
tumor should then be attacked by way of the vagina.
If the fibroid polyp projects from the external os, the
pedicle may very easily be divided with curved scissors.
If the tumor is still within the cavity of the uterus, it
will be necessary to dilate the cervix, or to enlarge the
canal by lateral incisions, so that the pedicle may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
reached. It should always be remembered that the polyp
may, by traction, produce partial or complete inversion
of the uterus (<a href="#fig_134">Fig. 134</a>), and in dividing the pedicle,
therefore, the operator should cut close to the tumor,
leaving, if necessary, a portion of the surface of the
tumor. In case the polyp is so large that the vagina is
filled to such an extent that the pedicle is not accessible,
it is advisable to remove the tumor piecemeal, grasping
portions with a tenaculum and cutting away with scissors
until the pedicle is reached. The fibroid polyp is not
vascular, and hemorrhage is not alarming. The pedicle
usually contains no large vessel. It retracts after the
tumor has been cut away, and spontaneous hemostasis is
secured. It was formerly the custom to ligate the pedicle
or to remove the polyp with the écraseur, but these
methods are unnecessary. If any hemorrhage should
follow the operation, the cavity of the uterus should be
packed with sterile gauze.</p>

<p><b id="ADENOMYOMA_OF_UTERUS">Adenomyoma</b> is a rare form of myoma of the uterus,
which contains epithelial canals of the glandular type.
Unlike the common fibromyoma, this tumor has no connective-tissue
capsule and its structure cannot be well
differentiated from the tissue of the surrounding uterine
wall.</p>

<p>Adenomyomata are of two varieties: in one variety the
epithelial canals seem to be derived from the utricular
glands; in the other from the embryonal remains of the
Wolffian body.</p>

<p>In the first variety the tumor is situated in the posterior,
anterior, or lateral uterine wall, and has the
usual characteristics of a fibromyoma, except for the
presence of glandular structures and the absence of a
capsule.</p>

<p>Adenomyomata, which are derived from the Wolffian
body, develop in the posterior portion of a uterine horn,
or less often in the tube, and when small, in the peripheral
layers of the muscular wall. The tumor may afterward
become interstitial or submucous.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>These tumors are of various degrees of hardness. They
may be dense in consistence, in case the muscular tissue
is in excess of the glandular, or they may be soft cystic
tumors containing numerous distinct macroscopic cavities.
Telangiectatic adenomyomata also occur.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> of adenomyoma of the uterus is hysterectomy.

<h3 id="HEMATOMETRA_HYDROMETRA_PYOMETRA">HEMATOMETRA; HYDROMETRA; PYOMETRA.</h3>

<p>If there exists in the genital tract any obstruction that
prevents the escape of menstrual blood, the uterus
will become distended and the condition of <i>hematometra</i>
will be present. If the retained fluid consists chiefly of
the mucous secretion of the utricular glands, the condition
is described as <i>hydrometra</i>; or if suppuration has
taken place, so that the uterus becomes distended with
pus, the condition is called <i>pyometra</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_135" src="images/fig_135.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 135.</span>&mdash;Hematometra.</p></div>

<p>The uterine walls may be very much attenuated by the
distention, or the muscular coat may hypertrophy as the
accumulation progresses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<p>The cause of these conditions may be congenital or
acquired atresia of any part of the genital tract. The
symptoms usually appear after puberty. The menstrual
period is accompanied by intense bearing-down pain in
the region of the uterus. There is no appearance of menstrual
blood. A round tumor may be felt in the hypogastrium.
Examination will reveal the obstruction in
the cervical canal. Sometimes the chief accumulation
and distention occur in the cervix; in other cases the
body of the uterus is chiefly affected.</p>

<p>Distention of the Fallopian tubes, with the formation
of hematosalpinx, hydrosalpinx, or pyosalpinx, often accompanies
old cases of hematometra.</p>

<p>The <b>treatment</b> consists in relieving the obstruction
and in maintaining the patulous condition of the genital
tract. If the cervix is the seat of the obstruction, it
should be punctured with a trocar and thoroughly dilated.
It may be necessary to practise repeated dilatation in
order to keep the canal open.</p>

<p>The accompanying disease of the Fallopian tubes may
persist after drainage of the uterus, and salpingo-oöphorectomy
or hysterectomy may be ultimately required.

<h3 id="TUBERCULOSIS_OF_THE_UTERUS">TUBERCULOSIS OF THE UTERUS.</h3>

<p>Tuberculosis of the uterus is not a very rare disease.
In this respect it differs from tuberculosis of the cervix,
which, as has already been said, is a most unusual site
for the appearance of tuberculosis. Even in advanced
cases of tuberculosis of the body of the uterus it is very
rare that the condition extends below the internal os.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis of the uterus is often found post-mortem
in women who have died of phthisis or other form of
tubercular disease. It has also been recognized during
life, and operation has been performed for its relief.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis of the uterus seems most frequently to be
secondary to a tubercular lesion in some other part of the
body. It often begins in the Fallopian tubes, and extends
thence to the endometrium; or it may be primary in the
endometrium, caused by infection through the genital
tract.</p>

<p>The disease first attacks the endometrium, and in the
late stages extends to the muscular coat.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis of the endometrium may occur in three
forms&mdash;miliary tuberculosis, chronic diffuse tuberculosis
(caseous endometritis), and chronic fibroid tuberculosis.</p>

<p><i>Miliary tuberculosis</i> of the uterus may be part of a
general miliary tuberculosis. Typical miliary tubercles
are found scattered throughout the endometrium, usually
situated immediately beneath the epithelium (<a href="#fig_136">Fig. 136</a>).</p>

<p><i>Chronic diffuse tuberculosis</i> is the most frequent form.
The uterine cavity is filled with cheesy material. The
mucous membrane is the seat of irregularly shaped ulcers
and tubercles in various stages of development. When
the disease has extended to the muscular coat of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
uterus, the whole organ becomes considerably enlarged.
Degeneration and softening of the uterine wall may be
so extensive as to cause rupture. The internal os may
become closed, and a pyometra may be produced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_136" src="images/fig_136.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 136.</span>&mdash;Miliary tuberculosis of the endometrium and glandular endometritis
(Beyea).</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 137.</span>&mdash;Advanced fibroid tuberculosis of the endometrium (Beyea).</p></div>

<p><i>Chronic fibroid tuberculosis</i> of the endometrium seems
to be the rarest form of the disease. A microscopic section
of this form of tuberculosis is shown in <a href="#fig_137">Fig. 137</a>.
The endometrial tissue was almost entirely destroyed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
and was replaced by a mass of typical miliary tubercles.
There were no traces of glandular tissue. The tubercles
were separated from each other by a very extensive small
round-cell infiltration and a small amount of remaining
stroma tissue. To the naked eye the endometrium did
not appear to be diseased.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis of the uterus may occur at any period of
life. It is most often found between the twentieth and
fortieth years.</p>

<p>The <b>symptoms</b> of tuberculosis of the uterus are not
at all characteristic. In the early stages they resemble
those of non-tubercular endometritis. There is sometimes
a very profuse leucorrhea, which may contain the characteristic
cheesy material. The body of the uterus may be
considerably hypertrophied. If the condition follows
tuberculosis elsewhere, or if any form of genital tuberculosis
exists in the husband, the physician would be led
to suspect tuberculosis of the uterus.</p>

<p>The <b>diagnosis</b> can be made only by thorough curetting
of the uterine cavity and the microscopic examination
of the tissue removed. The tubercle bacillus has
not often been found, but the other microscopic appearances
are frequently characteristic. In the case from
which the section shown in <a href="#fig_137">Fig. 137</a> was taken the diagnosis
of tuberculosis of the endometrium was made by
such curetting and examination.</p>

<p>The <b>treatment</b> of tuberculosis of the uterus is hysterectomy.
The operation is indicated in every case except
those in which there is present in some other part of the
body an incurable tubercular lesion.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3 id="INVERSION_OF_THE_UTERUS">INVERSION OF THE UTERUS.</h3>

<p>In inversion of the uterus this organ is turned partly
or completely inside out. The condition usually results
from childbirth or from the growth of an interstitial or
polypoid tumor.</p>

<p>There seem to be two factors that result in the production
of inversion: a degeneration or atrophy of part
of the uterine wall, and traction, as from the drag of a
uterine polyp or of the umbilical cord. These causes
may act together or independently.</p>

<p>If a portion of the uterine wall has lost its strength or
tonicity, it may be depressed toward the uterine cavity.
The depression is increased by the traction of a tumor or
of the umbilical cord. The inversion having been started
in this way, may be rapidly increased by uterine contractions.
Emmet says that inversion usually takes place
between the birth of the child and the delivery of the
placenta. A consideration of the subject of acute inversion
following labor belongs to obstetrics. It is very
important that reduction should be accomplished immediately.
The delay of a few hours greatly increases
the difficulty of replacement. Emmet says: “The uterus
is generally well contracted in twelve hours, and with
many cases it would be then quite as difficult to effect a
reduction as if a year had elapsed.”</p>

<p>If the placenta is still attached to the inverted uterus,
it should be removed before reduction is attempted. Inversion
of the uterus when seen by the gynecologist is
usually of the chronic form. It has existed for a few
weeks or for several years.</p>

<p>Various degrees of inversion are met with. Rarely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
inversion of one horn of the uterus is seen. In the case
of fibroid polyp there may be a slight depression of part
of the uterine wall, resulting from local atrophy and
traction. In other cases inversion of the fundus as far as
the internal os exists. The most usual condition is one
of complete inversion, in which the body of the uterus
protrudes from the external os into the vagina (<a href="#fig_138">Fig. 138</a>).
The cervix may or may not be inverted. Sometimes the
inversion is complicated by vaginal prolapse&mdash;or, rather,
by inversion of the vagina&mdash;so that the whole genital
tract becomes turned inside out and protrudes from the
vulva. The exposed endometrium becomes congested
and bleeds easily. Ulceration or gangrene may result.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_138" src="images/fig_138.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 138.</span>&mdash;Complete inversion of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>If the inversion is extensive, the Fallopian tubes and
the ovaries are drawn in the cup formed on the upper aspect
of the uterus. Intestines or omentum may also lie
in this cup. In cases of long standing the rim of the
cup formed by the muscular cervix becomes very much
contracted, and adhesions may take place between the
peritoneal surfaces. These complications offer great,
sometimes insurmountable, difficulty to reduction in old
cases.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<p>Inversion of the uterus is not a common disease. It is
very rarely seen at the present day.</p>

<p>By far the most frequent form is that which follows
labor; it is much less often caused by fibroid polyp. It
seems especially likely to occur in sarcoma of the uterus.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_139" src="images/fig_139.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 139.</span>&mdash;Inversion of the uterus (Jeançons): <i>a</i>, mons veneris; <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, nymphæ;
<i>d</i>, clitoris; <i>e</i>, external meatus; <i>g</i>, anterior lip of cervix; <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, the internal
surface of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>The symptoms of chronic inversion are hemorrhage,
discharge, backache, bearing-down pains in the pelvis,
vesical disturbance, very pronounced anemia, and general
physical weakness. Menstruation is very much increased
in amount, and intermenstrual bleeding may
occur after standing or on any physical effort.</p>

<p>Inversion of the uterus very rarely exists without causing
serious symptoms. The majority of unrelieved cases
end fatally from anemia, septicemia, or peritonitis. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
few cases of spontaneous reduction and cure have been
recorded.</p>

<p>The <b>diagnosis</b> of recent inversion is very easy. The
body of the uterus usually projects into the vagina, and
the placenta may be found attached to it. The abdominal
hand fails to feel the rounded body of the uterus in the
normal position, but in its place is a cup-shaped hollow.</p>

<p>Chronic inversion if uncomplicated by other lesion&mdash;<i>e. g.</i>
a uterine tumor&mdash;may also be readily recognized by
careful examination. There are, however, a number of
cases on record in which the inverted fundus uteri was
amputated in mistake for a fibroid polyp.</p>

<p>The diagnosis may be made by inspection, bimanual
examination, and the uterine sound.</p>

<p>In complete inversion, inspection shows a round tumor
filling the vagina or protruding from the vulva. The
tumor is covered with mucous membrane, perhaps ulcerated
in places, and sometimes partly covered with stratified
squamous epithelium, which has, as a result of irritation,
replaced the normal epithelium of the endometrium.
It is of a deeper red color than a pedunculated fibroid.
The tumor bleeds easily. In the only case of inversion
seen by the writer the orifices of the Fallopian tubes
could be determined.</p>

<p>Digital examination reveals the rounded shape of the
tumor and its soft character&mdash;softer than a fibroid polyp.
The tumor may be so soft that it becomes flattened against
the posterior vaginal wall.</p>

<p>The tumor is found to be free on all sides except at its
upper extremity, where there is a pedunculated attachment
around which may be felt the more or less attenuated
cervix.</p>

<p>If the cervical canal be not obliterated by adhesion to
the neck of the tumor, the finger may be passed upward,
and will determine that the mucous membrane is reflected
symmetrically all around on to the neck of the tumor.</p>

<p>Unless the woman be fat, the abdominal hand will
determine that the uterine body is not in its normal position.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
In its place may be felt the cup-shaped portion of
the inverted uterus.</p>

<p>If the woman be fat, the rim of the cup may be felt
by palpation through the rectum, the uterus being drawn
down, if necessary, by a tape passed around the upper
portion of the tumor.</p>

<p>The sound passed around the neck of the tumor will
show the diminished depth of the uterine cavity and the
symmetrical reflection of the cervix on to the neck of the
tumor.</p>

<p>If the inversion be partial, the fundus lying still above
the internal os, the difficulty of diagnosis becomes much
greater. Examination under anesthesia may be necessary,
when the cup-shaped depression on the top of the uterus
may be detected, and dilatation of the cervix will enable
the examiner to palpate the intra-uterine tumor.</p>

<p>The differential diagnosis between inversion and uterine
polyp is made by determining, in the latter condition,
that the body of the uterus lies in its normal relationship
to the cervix, and that the upper surface is not cupped.</p>

<p>The sound usually passes to unequal distances around
the neck of a fibroid polyp, unless it be situated symmetrically
in the centre of the fundus. The depth of the
uterus in the case of uterine polyp is usually greater than
two and a half inches, as a result of the hypertrophy that
accompanies polypi.</p>

<p>It is said that if the sound passes to a less depth than
two and a half inches in the case of uterine polyp, accompanying
partial inversion of the uterus should be
suspected.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;As I have already said, an inverted uterus
should be reduced immediately after the accident
occurs. If this is not done, the difficulties of reduction
become very great. Until about fifty years ago, reduction
in chronic cases was considered to be impossible. A
considerable variety of methods of reduction have been
recommended. Some operators advocate reduction by
the hands alone; others advise the assistance of instruments;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
and others, again, the employment of continuous
elastic pressure.</p>

<p>The woman should be kept in bed for a few days before
the operation. Saline laxatives should be administered.
The parts should be prepared by vaginal injections of hot
water in large quantity, administered three times a day.
A large Barnes bag or colpeurynter filled with air or
water should be placed in the vagina for two or three
days before the operation, in order to distend the genital
tract sufficiently to admit the hand. In some cases the
pressure of such a bag, applied for from one to eleven
days, has itself effected reduction. At the time of operation
an anesthetic should be administered and the woman
should be placed in the lithotomy position. The bladder
should be emptied.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_140" src="images/fig_140.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 140.</span>&mdash;White’s repositor for inversion of the uterus.</p></div>

<p>The hand should be greased before introduction into
the vagina. Emmet describes the method of reduction
as follows: “My hand was passed into the vagina, and,
with the fingers and thumb encircling the portion of the
body close to the seat of inversion, the fundus was
allowed to rest in the palm of the hand. This portion
of the body was firmly grasped, pushed upward, and the
fingers were then immediately separated to their utmost;
at the same time the other hand was employed over the
abdomen in the attempt to roll out the parts forming the
ring, by sliding the abdominal parietes over its edge.
This manœuver was repeated and continued. At length,
as the diameter of the uterine cervix and os was increased
by lateral dilatation with the outspread fingers, the long
diameter of the body of the uterus became shortened,
and the degree of inversion proportionally lessened.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
After the body had advanced well within the cervix,
steady upward pressure upon the fundus was applied by
the tips of all the fingers brought together.”</p>

<p>The reduction may be aided by the use of White’s
repositor (<a href="#fig_140">Fig. 140</a>). This instrument consists of an
india-rubber cup set on a curved iron staff which has at
its other end a stout spiral spring. The cup is placed
against the inverted fundus, and the spring against the
body of the operator, who is thus enabled to maintain
continuous pressure during the manipulations of his
fingers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_141" src="images/fig_141.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 141.</span>&mdash;Emmet’s method of retaining
partially reduced inversion.</p></div>

<p>Reduction of chronic inversion by manual methods is
a long and exhausting process, requiring sometimes three
or four hours for its accomplishment.
It is advisable
to have several assistants
for mutual relief.
It may be necessary to desist,
and to repeat the operation
when the condition
of the patient permits it.
In case the reduction can
be but partially accomplished,
or when, from
any cause, the attempt at
reduction has to be temporarily
abandoned, the
result of the work done may be preserved by a method
of Emmet’s of temporarily closing the cervix by suture
(<a href="#fig_141">Fig. 141</a>). This procedure not only prevents the complete
inversion from returning, but the traction produced
by stretching the cervix over the fundus itself favors
reduction.</p>

<p><i>Reduction by Continuous Elastic Pressure.</i>&mdash;This
method is employed after the manual method has failed,
or it may be used primarily. As has been said, the
gradual pressure of a colpeurynter has in several instances
accomplished reduction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p>The most efficient instrument for maintaining continuous
pressure consists of a wooden cup set on a stem that
extends out of the vagina. Pressure is made by firm
elastic bands attached to the stem; these bands pass, two
in front and two behind, to a broad abdominal bandage.
The elastic pressure is maintained for from one to three
weeks.</p>

<p>The parts must be carefully watched for sloughing.
The rim of the cup of the repositor should be covered
with lint saturated with carbolized oil. The instrument
should be removed and reapplied every day.</p>

<p>The direction of pressure may be regulated by the
tension of the elastic bands.</p>

<p>Splitting the posterior lip of the cervix is sometimes a
useful procedure in cases that have resisted other treatment.
The cervix is split in the median line posteriorly;
the body and fundus are replaced by taxis, and the incision
is then closed by suture.</p>

<p>If inversion accompany a uterine polyp, the tumor
should be removed; and if the inversion is not spontaneously
corrected, it must be reduced.</p>

<p>If, after careful trial of conservative methods, reduction
of an inverted uterus is found to be impossible, the
physician may be compelled to amputate the inverted
portion or perform hysterectomy.

<h3 id="DISEASES_OF_THE_FALLOPIAN_TUBES">DISEASES OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES.</h3>

<p>The review of a few facts about the anatomy of the
Fallopian tubes will assist in the study of the diseases
that affect these structures.</p>

<p>The average length of the normal Fallopian tube is 4
inches (10 centimeters). The tubes are often of unequal
length, the difference sometimes being equal to 1 centimeter.
The length of the Fallopian tube is subject to
considerable variation, and in some forms of ovarian disease
the length of the tube may be very much increased.</p>

<p>The uterine end of the tube varies in thickness from
2 to 4 millimeters. The outer end varies from 7 to 10
millimeters in thickness.</p>

<p>The narrow uterine end of the tube is called the isthmus.
The outer end, of trumpet-shape, is called the
ampulla. The canal of the tube is small. At the uterine
end, or ostium internum, it will barely admit a bristle.
Beyond the middle of the tube the canal gradually widens
to the outer opening&mdash;the ostium abdominale.</p>

<p>The ostium abdominale is surrounded by peculiar
luxuriant folds of mucous membrane called fimbriæ.
The fimbriæ are formed by the outward bulging of the
exuberant mucous membrane.</p>

<p>The Fallopian tube consists of three coats, the peritoneal,
the muscular, and the mucous.</p>

<p>The peritoneal coat, which invests the tube for two-thirds
of its circumference, is formed by the free border
of the broad ligament, between the folds of which the
Fallopian tube lies. Loose connective tissue attaches the
peritoneal to the middle or muscular coat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>The muscular coat consists of unstriped muscular fiber
which is continuous with that of the uterus. The muscular
fibers are arranged in two layers, an outer longitudinal
and an inner circular layer.</p>

<p>The inner or mucous coat, which is continuous with
the mucous membrane of the uterus, is covered with
columnar ciliated epithelium.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_142" src="images/fig_142.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 142.</span>&mdash;Section of the normal Fallopian tube near the uterine cornu (Beyea).</p></div>

<p>In the outer portion of the tube the mucous membrane
is thrown into longitudinal folds or plicæ. These folds
increase in thickness and in number as the ostium abdominale
is approached. The difference in the degree
of plication at the two ends of the tube is shown by
<a href="#fig_142">Figs. 142</a>, <a href="#fig_143">143</a>. The folds of mucous membrane project
beyond the ostium to form the fimbriæ. Like the rest
of the mucous membrane, the fimbriæ are covered by
columnar ciliated epithelium.</p>

<p>The peritoneal covering does not, as a rule, extend on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
to the fimbriæ. It terminates by a sharp line which
marks also the termination of the circular muscular fibers
of the middle coat of the tube. The fimbriæ are subject
to great variation in number and in distribution. Sometimes
the Fallopian tube has one or two accessory ostia
in the vicinity of the usual opening. These accessory ostia
are situated on the upper aspect of the tube and are surrounded
by more or less luxuriant fimbriæ. Occasionally
a small pedunculated tuft of fimbriæ is found on the
outer portion of the tube (<a href="#fig_144">Fig. 144</a>, <i>B</i>). In some cases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
there is an accessory tubal end supplied with an ostium
(<a href="#fig_144">Fig. 144</a>, <i>A</i>).</p>

<i>b</i>, cyst of Kobelt’s tube; <i>c</i>, Gärtner’s duct.</p></div>

<p>Very often a small pedunculated cyst, about the size
of a pea, is found attached to the fimbriæ or to the outer
aspect of the tube.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p>These cysts are called hydatids, or cysts of Morgagni.
They are said to occur in about 8 per cent. of adults and
in 20 per cent. of fetuses. They are not pathological.</p>

<p>The cyst wall is composed of three coats: an external
peritoneal coat; a middle muscular coat, arranged in two
layers; and an inner mucous coat covered with columnar
ciliated epithelium. The cyst contains a clear watery
fluid.</p>

<p>No distinct glands, such as are found in the cervix and
the body of the uterus, have been observed in the Fallopian
tubes. The mucous crypts formed by the folds of
the mucous membrane are probably glandular in character
and secrete an albuminous fluid.</p>

<h4 id="INFLAMMATION_OF_THE_FALLOPIAN_TUBES_OR_SALPINGITIS">INFLAMMATION OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES, OR SALPINGITIS.</h4>

<p>Inflammation is the disease that most usually affects
the Fallopian tubes. The condition is, as a rule, secondary
to endometritis, the mucous membrane of the tubes
becoming inflamed by direct extension from the mucous
membrane of the uterus.</p>

<p>The causes of salpingitis are as numerous as those of
endometritis. The most common causes of salpingitis are
sepsis and gonorrhea.</p>

<p>Any form of inflammation of the endometrium may
extend to the Fallopian tubes, but the septic and the
gonorrheal forms of endometritis are especially virulent,
and it is the rule in these diseases that the tubes are
affected.</p>

<p>The various forms of glandular and interstitial endometritis
that have already been described, and which are
due to subinvolution, laceration of the cervix, uterine
displacements, fibroid tumors, etc., may exist for a long
time without producing any perceptible disease of the
tubes. In sepsis and gonorrhea, however, the tubes become
very quickly affected after the uterine cavity has
been invaded, and for this reason these forms of endometritis
excite the greatest apprehension.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

<p>Like inflammation of other structures, salpingitis may
be either acute or chronic.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_146" src="images/fig_146.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 146.</span>&mdash;Acute septic salpingitis: section about the middle of the tube
(Beyea).</p></div>

<p><b id="ACUTE_SALPINGITIS">Acute Salpingitis.</b>&mdash;In the first stages of acute salpingitis
the disease is confined to the mucous membrane
of the tube. It very quickly extends thence, however,
to the muscular and peritoneal coats, which become infiltrated
with embryonic cells characteristic of the early
stages of inflammation (<a href="#fig_146">Fig. 146</a>).</p>

<p>If the tube is laid open, the mucous membrane is found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
covered with a muco-purulent secretion. The whole
tube is soft, succulent, and friable. The friability is
such that the tube may readily be ruptured by bending.
The fimbriæ are swollen and congested. A drop of pus
is often seen exuding from the ostium abdominale.</p>

<p>In acute salpingitis the tube may become very quickly
(in a week or ten days) enlarged to the size of the index
finger or the thumb.</p>

<p>The condition that has been described is that found in
the severe cases of acute salpingitis, the result of gonorrhea
or of sepsis after labor. Opportunity is afforded to
examine such cases when the woman has been subjected
to celiotomy, or at the post-mortem when the woman has
died of acute peritonitis or sepsis.</p>

<p>It is probable that a good many cases of acute salpingitis
undergo resolution, and that the tube is restored to
its normal condition.</p>

<p>It is also probable that milder forms of acute salpingitis
occur&mdash;cases in which the disease is limited to the
mucous membrane and is merely catarrhal in character,
there being no pus, but a hypersecretion of mucus from
the tube-lining. Such cases, however, recover or pass
into a chronic form of simple catarrhal salpingitis; and
the diagnosis made by a study of the subjective and objective
symptoms cannot be confirmed by operation or
autopsy.</p>

<p>Resolution with perfect restoration of the Fallopian tube
to its normal condition is, of course, always to be hoped
for. In some cases a few fine peritoneal adhesions between
the tube and neighboring structures&mdash;such as the
ovary, the uterus, the anterior or the posterior surfaces
of the broad ligament, or a loop of intestine&mdash;may result
before resolution takes place, and persist after all other
traces of inflammation have disappeared. In other cases
cure may result, after a greater or less degree of permanent
damage has been done to the abdominal ostium of
the tube, by the shrinking and distortion or crumpling of
the fimbriæ. Such indications of an old, cured attack
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
of salpingitis are not infrequently seen during celiotomy
for other conditions.</p>

<p>When resolution and cure do not occur, a speedy fatal
result may take place by direct extension of the infection
from the tube to the general peritoneum, with the production
of general peritonitis. Between this extreme
and the mild forms of very localized peritonitis, marked
by a few harmless adhesions, all degrees may exist.
Sometimes a local accumulation of pus occurs in the
pelvis, walled off from the general peritoneum by rapidly
formed adhesions. In other cases a tubal abscess is
quickly formed by inflammatory closure of the abdominal
ostium and distention of the tube with pus; or the
cellular tissue of the broad ligament may become infected,
and the abscess may originate there. And,
finally, if the woman escape these dangers, one or other
of the various forms of chronic salpingitis may result,
and render her a lifelong invalid.</p>

<p><b id="CHRONIC_SALPINGITIS">Chronic Salpingitis.</b>&mdash;Salpingitis is usually seen in
the chronic form. An acute primary salpingitis must
not be confounded with an acute attack of inflammation
or with an acute exacerbation in an old chronic case. It
is rare that acute gonorrheal salpingitis is seen. The
disease is usually subacute or chronic from the beginning,
as are many of the other manifestations of gonorrhea
in woman, like gonorrheal cervicitis and endometritis.
The most frequent form of acute salpingitis met with
is the septic variety, which occurs as a result of septic
infection after a criminal abortion, a miscarriage, or a
labor. It is usually complicated by severe septic endometritis,
peritonitis, or general sepsis.</p>

<p>The lesions found in chronic salpingitis are numerous.
The simplest form of the disease is the <i>chronic catarrhal
salpingitis</i>, in which the pathological changes are confined
to the mucous membrane of the tube. The muscular
and peritoneal coats are not affected. The ostium
abdominale remains open and is of the normal shape.
The mucous membrane is congested. The folds of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
mucous membrane, or the plicæ, are hypertrophied from
gradual infiltration of inflammatory products. The tube
may become somewhat enlarged and more tortuous than
normal. If the inflammatory condition extends to the
middle or muscular coat of the tube, the <i>interstitial</i>
form of salpingitis is produced. The wall of the tube
becomes thicker and harder. The microscope shows an
increased amount of connective tissue in the tube-wall.</p>

<p>As chronic salpingitis progresses the ciliæ of the lining
cells disappear.</p>

<p>If the disease extends through the peritoneal coat, inflammatory
adhesions take place between the tube and
neighboring structures. The tube is often found adherent
to the posterior aspect of the uterus, the broad ligament,
or the ovary.</p>

<p>The most usual seat of adhesions is about the abdominal
ostium. Adhesions here are caused by leakage or escape
of septic material into the peritoneal cavity. The leakage
is slow, and the gradually formed adhesions in time
close the ostium by gluing it to adjacent structures, so
that further escape of tubal contents by this opening is
stopped.</p>

<p>If, in such a case, the tube is freed from its adhesions,
the fimbriæ will be found in the normal position with the
ostium abdominale open.</p>

<p>The usual method of closure of the distal end of the
Fallopian tube is by another process. It takes place as
follows: When the inflammation reaches the muscular
coat of the tube, this coat becomes lengthened and extends
beyond the fimbriæ, which apparently retract and
become invaginated in the tube. The opening of the
tube, instead of being flaring with protruding, diverging
fimbriæ, becomes rounded and narrow (<a href="#fig_147">Fig. 147</a>).
The fimbriæ become drawn farther into the tube until
they appear to be directed inward instead of outward.
The ostium becomes narrower, and more rounded,
until the edges finally meet and unite by peritoneal
adhesions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>Tubes representing all stages of this process of closure
are often found in operating for inflammatory disease.</p>

<p>Closure of the abdominal ostium by any method is to
be viewed as a conservative process. It prevents leakage,
through this channel, of septic material, and consequently
diminishes the danger of peritonitis.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_147" src="images/fig_147.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 147.</span>&mdash;Salpingitis with partial inversion of the fimbriæ.</p></div>

<p>When the abdominal ostium has become closed, the
tubal contents and secretions may have a sufficient
passage for escape by the isthmus into the uterus, and
no further changes take place beyond slow infiltration
and degeneration of the tube-walls. The tube may become
much hypertrophied, not from distention of the
lumen, but as the result of simple inflammatory infiltration
of the mucous and muscular coats, and may attain
the size of the thumb. The walls may become much
degenerated, soft, and friable, so that the tube may easily
be cut through by a ligature or may be broken by bending.</p>

<p>The whole tube may become much elongated and very
tortuous, reaching a length of six or eight inches. The
isthmus of the tube, or the portion in immediate relation
to the uterus, is usually least affected. The whole tube
may become much hypertrophied, and yet the isthmus
will remain approximately of its normal size. In other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
cases, however, the disease extends throughout the whole
length of the tube into the uterine horn, and the degeneration
of the tube may be such that it may readily be
broken off at its junction with the uterus.</p>

<p>If, after the ostium abdominale has been closed, anything
occurs to obstruct the escape of the tubal contents
into the uterus, cystic distention of the tube will take
place. Such obstruction may be produced by swelling
of the mucous membrane in the narrow isthmus; by cicatricial
contraction; or by a sharp flexure in any part of
the tortuous tube. Sometimes there are two or more
distended portions of the same tube.</p>

<p>When the tube is distended with pus, the condition is
called a <i>pyosalpinx</i>; when distended with a watery fluid,
a <i>hydrosalpinx</i>; and when distended with blood, a <i>hematosalpinx</i>.</p>

<p>Tubal cysts of this kind may attain large size, in some
cases equal to that of the fetal head.</p>

<p>The shape of the tube becomes much altered. The
greatest distention is at the distal portion, so that the
tube assumes a pear-shape. The lower portion of the
tube is restrained by the mesosalpinx and the tubo-ovarian
ligament, so that as the tube increases in length the
upper portion appears to outgrow the lower, and a retort-shaped
tumor results, or the tube may become tortuous
and folded upon itself.</p>

<p>As the tube enlarges the layers of the mesosalpinx
may become separated, and the tube burrows between
them until it is brought into immediate contact with the
ovary, and the retort-shaped tumor appears with the ovary
lying in the concave portion.</p>

<p>In some cases the ovary and the tube become adherent
by peritoneal adhesions, and the mesosalpinx, which is
wrinkled and folded between them, may be restored by
separation of the adhesions.</p>

<p>In other cases the mesosalpinx itself becomes much
thickened by inflammatory infiltration, and keeps the
tube and ovary separated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

<p>In chronic salpingitis the inflammatory process usually
in time extends to the ovary, and some of the forms
of chronic ovaritis are produced.</p>

<p>The capsule of the ovary becomes thickened, and rupture
of the ripe ovarian follicles is prevented. Small
cysts throughout the ovary are formed in this way. Two
or more cysts may become converted into one cavity by
absorption of the intervening walls, so that cystic spaces
of larger size, equal to that of a duck-egg, may result.
Such cysts may become infected by pyogenic organisms
from the tube, and an ovarian abscess is produced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_148" src="images/fig_148.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 148.</span>&mdash;Tubo-ovarian abscess.</p></div>

<p><i>Tubo-ovarian Abscess.</i>&mdash;If the tube is brought into
immediate contact with the ovary, either by agglutination
of the fimbriated end to the surface of the ovary, or
by adhesion of the side of the tube to the ovary, or by
burrowing between the layers of the broad ligament, the
tissue intervening between the cavity of the tube and
the cyst of the ovary may be absorbed or perforated, and
the two cavities will be thrown into one, forming a
tubo-ovarian abscess or a tubo-ovarian cyst (<a href="#fig_148">Fig. 148</a>).
The opening between the tubal and ovarian portions of
the cyst does not usually correspond to the abdominal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
ostium of the tube, but may be an adventitious opening
in the side of the tube (<a href="#fig_148">Fig. 148</a>).</p>

<p><i>Pyosalpinx.</i>&mdash;When the Fallopian tube is distended
with pus or with other fluid, its walls gradually become
thinned. In this respect the Fallopian tube differs from
the body of the uterus, in which a hypertrophy of the
muscular coat usually takes place, under the influence of
distention from the presence of retained fluid within it.</p>

<p>This gradual thinning of the tube-wall predisposes to
rupture or leakage and the escape of the contents into
the abdominal cavity. A pyosalpinx often becomes adherent
to the rectum, the small intestine, or the bladder.
The wall of the intestine or the bladder becomes perforated,
and the pus is discharged in this way. It seems
probable that in some unusual cases the obstruction in
the lumen of the tube is temporarily overcome, and that
evacuation takes place through the uterus, followed by
refilling of the tube. This, however, is a very unusual
occurrence, and is not frequent, as is assumed by some
writers. The evidence of such discharge is based only on
clinical observation. There is no good pathological evidence
of such an occurrence. It is probable that in most
of the reported cases the purulent or watery discharge
which escaped in a sudden gush was derived from, and
had been retained in, the body of the uterus.</p>

<p>The pus of pyosalpinx varies greatly in character. In
the early stages of the disease it is actively septic and
contains a variety of micro-organisms.</p>

<p>These organisms are the gonococcus, streptococcus,
staphylococcus, the bacillus coli communis, the tubercle
bacillus, and the pneumococcus.</p>

<p>In the later stages, however, these organisms become
inert, die, and disappear, so that in the majority of cases
of chronic pyosalpinx the pus is found to be bacteriologically
sterile. Observation on this subject made
by a number of investigators shows that out of 133
cases of acute and chronic suppuration of the uterine appendages
in which the pus was examined bacteriologically,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
no organisms whatever were found in 82 cases; in
other words, the pus was sterile in about 61 per cent. of
the cases. The pyosalpinx in time, therefore, becomes
inert so far as any active inflammatory action is concerned,
and resembles a chronic abscess in other parts of the body.
Active inflammatory action may, however, be excited at
any time, as in other chronic abscess, by a new infection,
septic organisms entering the abscess by way of the uterine
cavity, an adherent loop of intestine, or the bladder.
The woman will then have an attack of acute septic inflammation
in the old pyosalpinx, and will be exposed to
the various dangers that were imminent during the primary
acute stages of the disease.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_149" src="images/fig_149.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 149.</span>&mdash;Hydrosalpinx, showing complete inversion of the fimbriæ.</p></div>

<p>It seems probable that if the woman survive the dangers
to which she is exposed from a pyosalpinx, the
tumor may in time become converted into a hydrosalpinx.
The solid constituents of the fluid become absorbed
or deposited upon the cyst-walls, and a clear
watery fluid remains. In hydrosalpinx the recesses of
the tube are often found to contain cheesy material and
cholesterin&mdash;remnants of the old purulent accumulation.
The tubo-ovarian cyst is formed in this way from a former
tubo-ovarian abscess.</p>

<p><i>Hydrosalpinx.</i>&mdash;The fluid in a hydrosalpinx may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
colorless, slightly yellow, or brownish or chocolate
colored from the presence of blood. As the accumulation
increases, the walls of the cyst atrophy and become
very thin. The epithelium and the mucous membrane
atrophy and in time disappear, until nothing but a thin-walled
transparent cyst remains (<a href="#fig_149">Fig. 149</a>). The cyst-wall
in hydrosalpinx is always thinner and more transparent
than that in pyosalpinx. On the inner wall of
the cyst delicate ridges corresponding to the plicæ or
folds of mucous membrane may be traced. There may
often be discovered, at the distal end of the retort-shaped
tumor, a slight depression that marks the position of the
abdominal ostium, while upon the inner aspect of this
depression may be found the remains of the invaginated
fimbriæ. The size of the tube in hydrosalpinx varies
from that of the little finger to a tumor as large as the
fetal head. Large hydrosalpinx tumors are very unusual,
because the fluid probably leaks slowly through the thin
cyst-wall, and because the secreting surface of the cyst
becomes destroyed by pressure. The fluid from a hydrosalpinx
is sterile, unirritating to the peritoneum, and is
readily absorbed. The cyst may rupture spontaneously
or as the result of some slight accident; the fluid will be
absorbed by the peritoneum, and only the shrivelled,
atrophied sac will remain. In old cases of this kind the
Fallopian tube is represented by an impervious cord.
Such specimens have often been found in old prostitutes
who have survived the dangers of their calling.</p>

<p><i>Hematosalpinx.</i>&mdash;True hematosalpinx, a closed Fallopian
tube distended with blood, is a rare condition.
Tubal pregnancy is the usual cause of an accumulation
of blood in the Fallopian tube, but the term hematosalpinx
should not be applied to this condition. True
hematosalpinx occurs when, from any cause, hemorrhage
takes place into a tube that had previously been closed
by inflammatory action. Such an accident may be caused
by traumatism or by torsion of the pedicle of a tubal cyst.
Slight hemorrhages of this kind occur in pyosalpinx and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
in hydrosalpinx, and cause the brownish discoloration
that is sometimes seen in the contents of these tumors.</p>

<p>The various forms of inflammatory disease of the tubes
that have been described under names which designate
the gross appearance of the disease are all really but different
manifestations of the same primary condition.
Gonorrheal or septic infection may produce any of the
forms of tubal disease that have been mentioned. Interstitial
salpingitis without closure of the ostium, pyosalpinx,
hydrosalpinx, hematosalpinx, tubo-ovarian abscess,
etc. are not distinct diseases, but are different manifestations
of the same disease, representing different stages of
progress or different methods of development. Several
of these different forms are often found in the same
woman. On one side there may be a hydrosalpinx, on
the other a pyosalpinx, both caused by a primary chronic
gonorrhea; the distal end of one tube may be distended
by a clear watery fluid, forming a hydrosalpinx, while the
isthmus may be distended with pus, forming a pyosalpinx;
a hematosalpinx may be formed on one side, while
a tubo-ovarian abscess exists on the other; and so through
a great variety of combinations.</p>

<p>Pyosalpinx with active septic contents represents the
early stages of tubal disease, or it represents a chronic
condition in which reinfection has occurred. Pyosalpinx
with sterile pus is like a chronic abscess anywhere else,
and represents a chronic form of salpingitis that had been
active and purulent in the beginning. Hydrosalpinx
represents the disease less violent and septic in the beginning,
and slow in progress; or it represents the last stages
of an old pyosalpinx; while, finally, hematosalpinx represents
a condition of salpingitis in which some accident
has befallen the cystic tube and caused hemorrhage into
its cavity.</p>

<p>The description given shows the progress, the dangers,
and the terminations of salpingitis.</p>

<p>The disease is caused by extension of inflammation
from the endometrium. The usual causes of this inflammation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
are gonorrhea, or infection after a criminal abortion,
a labor, or a miscarriage. The gonorrheal salpingitis
is usually slow or insidious from the beginning.
The symptoms of the disease are often not troublesome
until many months after the primary gonorrheal infection.
The closure of the tube is slow, and it is sometimes
not until the tube becomes distended with pus that
the woman experiences much suffering and is placed in
imminent danger. There are cases, however, of acute
gonorrheal salpingitis in which the disease is virulent
and active from the beginning. Infection may traverse
the tube, reach the peritoneum through the open ostium,
and produce general peritonitis within a few days of the
primary attack of gonorrhea. In such cases it is probable
that the infection is a mixed one, other organisms
accompanying the gonococcus. In other cases the abdominal
ostium becomes quickly closed and a gonorrheal
tubal abscess is rapidly formed.</p>

<p>The septic variety of salpingitis, as has already been
said, is more frequently acute from the beginning. Within
ten days or two weeks after a criminal abortion, or after
a miscarriage or labor, a large tubal abscess may be
formed; or the septic organisms may pass through the
tube before the ostium has been closed, and produce within
a few days a general fatal peritonitis.</p>

<p>On the other hand, septic salpingitis is often slow, a
mild attack of puerperal sepsis being the beginning of
years of invalidism, of gradually increasing suffering,
until gross tubal disease is produced.</p>

<p>The slowest forms of salpingitis are those that result
from chronic endometritis, such as accompanies subinvolution,
laceration of the cervix, retro-displacements, or
uterine fibroid. Simple catarrhal salpingitis is often found
in these diseases; or the abdominal ostium may be closed,
and a small hydrosalpinx will be present; or the isthmus
may be sufficiently open for drainage, and no tubal distention
result. Hydrosalpinx is very often found with
uterine fibroids.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p>Cancer of the cervix or the body of the uterus is a frequent
cause of salpingitis, of hydrosalpinx, and of pyosalpinx.
The endometrial inflammation secondary to the
cancer extends into the tubes.</p>

<p>The progress of salpingitis is beset with danger.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_150" src="images/fig_150.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 150.</span>&mdash;Chronic salpingitis with general adhesions of tubes, ovaries, and
uterus (Bandl).</p></div>

<p>At any time a pyosalpinx may rupture and a rapid fatal
peritonitis result. Unusual effort, vaginal examination,
or slight operations upon the cervix or body of the uterus
may cause this accident. Not infrequently, such
rupture has been produced by even gentle bimanual examination.
I have seen a fatal peritonitis occur from
rupture of a pyosalpinx during the replacement of a prolapsed
uterus.</p>

<p>For this reason the operator should always determine
by careful examination the presence or absence of tubal
disease in every case before performing any of the minor
gynecological operations or manipulations, such as trachelorrhaphy
or the replacement of a retroverted uterus.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Purulent disease of the tubes is a contraindication to all
such procedures, unless an immediate subsequent celiotomy
is to be performed. Great care must be exercised
in any of the less dangerous forms of salpingitis. In
any case of salpingitis, however mild, an acute attack
may be excited by reinfection or by rough manipulation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_151" src="images/fig_151.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 151.</span>&mdash;Chronic salpingitis: both Fallopian tubes are closed and adherent.</p></div>

<p>Rupture into the peritoneum is not the only danger to
which the woman is exposed in salpingitis. The gradually
formed adhesions in the pelvis impede the motion of
the pelvic intestines and may cause intestinal obstruction.
Obstruction of the ureters has occurred from pelvic
inflammation. The Fallopian tube may discharge
its contents through the bladder and produce violent cystitis,
or it may discharge through the rectum or intestine,
or adhere to the side of the vagina and discharge through
this channel; or it may be evacuated through the abdominal
parietes. Such fistulous openings rarely, if ever,
close spontaneously and permanently. Temporary closure
may occur, but the tube will refill and discharge as
before.</p>

<p>Fistulæ of this kind persist for many years, becoming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
seats of tuberculosis or exhausting the woman by the
continuous suppuration.</p>

<p>If the patient escape these dangers, the disease may
become quiescent. Some of the less dangerous forms of
salpingitis are produced, until finally, when the woman
has reached middle life, a hydrosalpinx remains, or an
adherent, atrophied, cord-like remnant of the tube.
Though then freed from the various dangers that had
threatened her life, she is not restored to health, but
remains a suffering invalid.</p>

<p>Salpingitis may be unilateral or bilateral. It is more
likely to be unilateral in the acute cases than in the
chronic, for, as the primary focus of the disease exists in
the body of the uterus, it will extend in time to the second
tube in case only one had at first been involved. If
the endometrial disease is cured before the second tube
has been attacked, the salpingitis may remain unilateral.
Double salpingitis is especially likely to occur in those
diseases of the endometrium that are difficult or impossible
to eradicate&mdash;diseases like chronic gonorrhea, where
the infection lurks in the distal ends of the utricular
glands and defies our methods of treatment. Operators
have repeatedly removed a unilateral pyosalpinx, leaving
the second tube apparently perfectly healthy, and yet,
after the lapse of a few months, a second operation has
been necessary for the relief of a similar pyosalpinx on
the other side.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms of Acute and Chronic Salpingitis.</b>&mdash;The
symptoms of acute salpingitis are usually obscured by
the accompanying symptoms of endometritis, ovarian
congestion and inflammation, and localized peritonitis.
The woman complains of pelvic pain and tenderness,
which are most severe in one or both ovarian regions.
There are elevation of temperature and rapid pulse. The
knees are often drawn up as in peritonitis.</p>

<p>Bimanual examination reveals marked tenderness upon
pressure in the vaginal fornices. There is an indistinct
sense of fulness in the region of the tubes. If the pelvic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
peritoneum and cellular tissue are involved, the whole
vaginal vault will feel full and resistant. The tissues
lying to the sides and behind the uterus are thickened
and resistant. If the woman is thin and there is not
much surrounding inflammation, it is sometimes possible
to palpate the enlarged tender tube between the vaginal
finger and the abdominal hand. Usually, however, the
tenderness is too great to permit this. The tube, from
its increase in weight, may fall below its normal level,
and may be felt lying behind the uterus in Douglas’s
pouch.</p>

<p>Usually, in cases of acute salpingitis, the examiner is
obliged to content himself with the determination of an
indistinct fulness and marked tenderness in the region of
the Fallopian tubes.</p>

<p>Before the true pathology of salpingitis was known
these cases were described as pelvic peritonitis or pelvic
cellulitis. It was supposed that the inflammation involved
the peritoneum of the pelvis or the cellular tissue
of the broad ligaments. It is true that this is often the
case, and that inflammation of these structures accompanies
the salpingitis, but it is the tubal inflammation
which is the primary disease.</p>

<p>The most pronounced symptom of chronic salpingitis
is <i>pain</i>. The pain is referred to one or to both ovarian
regions as the disease is unilateral or bilateral. It is due
not only to the salpingitis, but to the accompanying ovaritis.
The pain is continuous. It is relieved by the recumbent
posture, and is increased whenever the woman
is upon her feet or is performing any work. The pain
is increased by a jolt or sudden movement, by defecation,
often by urination and by coitus. The pain during coitus,
from direct pressure, is often so great that marital
relations are abolished. I have seen a woman with salpingitis
who was obliged to take a dose of morphine
before every act of defecation. The pain from the jolting
of a carriage often renders riding impossible.</p>

<p>The pain is dull and aching in character or sharp and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
lancinating. It may extend down the anterior aspect of
the thighs.</p>

<p>The pain is very much worse at each menstrual period.
All the genital structures become congested and swollen
at this time, and such phenomena, occurring in the adherent
inflamed tubes and ovaries, often cause unbearable
pain. The dysmenorrhea in salpingitis is usually
very characteristic. It begins several days&mdash;sometimes a
week&mdash;before the bleeding appears. It starts in one or
both ovarian regions, and radiates thence throughout the
pelvis and down the thighs. It will be remembered that
the dysmenorrhea of anteflexion begins only a few hours
before the bleeding&mdash;that the pain is usually situated in
the center of the lower abdomen, in the region of the
uterus, is expulsive in character, and is relieved when
the bleeding has become well established.</p>

<p>The dysmenorrhea of salpingitis usually lasts throughout
the whole of the period.</p>

<p>The pain of salpingitis persists throughout the whole
course of the disease. It is common to all forms of salpingitis,
and seems to bear no relation to the gross character
of the lesions of the tubes. The pain and the
dysmenorrhea are often as marked in a case of salpingitis
without cystic distention as in a case of large pyosalpinx.</p>

<p>The pain persists after the dangerous stages of the disease
have been passed. Relief begins only with the
cessation of menstruation, when general atrophy takes
place in the genital organs.</p>

<p>The pain of salpingitis is often obvious from the expression
and the posture of the woman. She walks with
the body slightly flexed forward; she sits down gently
upon a chair; she protects herself, by support with the
hand, from the jolting of a carriage or a car.</p>

<p>The woman frequently suffers with marked exacerbations
of the pain, which occur independently of the menstrual
periods, and are caused by leakage from the tube
and the resulting local peritonitis. The woman often
describes such attacks as attacks of “inflammation of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
bowels.” They occur usually during the early stages of
the disease. Each attack, if survived, results in a more
perfect closure of the ostium abdominale, and diminishes
the risk of subsequent attacks. At these times all the
symptoms of local peritonitis are present: elevated temperature,
rapid pulse, local or general distention, and
tenderness. In any case of pyosalpinx or of old chronic
salpingitis close questioning of the patient will elicit a
history of this kind.</p>

<p>Acute attacks of pain, fever, and other disturbance
also occur in cases of chronic salpingitis from acute reinfection
of the diseased tube. The disease may have
been quiescent for a long time, and yet active reinfection
may take place by way of the uterine cavity or by the
passage of the colon bacillus through an adherent intestinal
wall; or infection may occur through an adherent
bladder.</p>

<p>Salpingitis is usually accompanied by menorrhagia.
It is impossible to determine how much of this is to be
attributed to the tubal disease. There is always an accompanying
endometritis which is sufficient to account
for it.</p>

<p>Sterility is the rule in cases of salpingitis. The disease
of the mucous membrane and the destruction of the ciliæ
render the passage of the ovum into the uterus difficult.
For this reason tubal pregnancy may occur in salpingitis,
impregnation and attachment of the ovum taking place
within the tube. Inflammation of the ovary, which prevents
the rupture of the ripened ovarian follicles, is another
cause of the sterility. When the abdominal ostia
are closed absolute sterility is present.</p>

<p>In chronic salpingitis the condition of the Fallopian
tubes is revealed by bimanual examination. The tube
usually falls below its normal level, and may be felt by
the vaginal finger lying beside the uterus, or behind it,
in Douglas’s pouch. By careful palpation the connection
of the tubal tumor with the uterus may be traced. Bimanual
examination is most satisfactory in the quiescent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
stages of the disease. During an exacerbation or during
one of the acute attacks of inflammation the tenderness
prohibits thorough palpation, and the surrounding inflammatory
infiltration masks the condition of the tube. The
tube may be felt as a hard cord, or as a cystic tumor with
the ovary lying in its concavity, or as a tortuous, sausage-shaped
mass.</p>

<p>In old chronic cases the tube and ovary may be felt as
a hard, knot-like mass adherent to the side of the uterus
or coiled about the cornu (<a href="#fig_151">Fig. 151</a>).</p>

<p>In nearly every case the isthmus is rendered hard and
cord-like by inflammatory infiltration. This indurated
condition of the isthmus is a feature of tubal disease that
is usually readily determined, and it is of decided diagnostic
value. The connection, by such a cord, of the
mass felt in the pelvis with the uterine cornu is the
most valuable proof that the tumor is tubal in character.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis.</b>&mdash;The diagnosis of chronic disease of the
Fallopian tubes must be made from a study of the history,
the symptoms, and by physical examination.</p>

<p>The history is always of value. Careful questioning
will usually show that the ovarian pain dates from a
criminal abortion, from an attack of fever after a miscarriage
or labor, or from a suspicious coitus. Women who
have been infected with chronic gonorrhea by their husbands
attribute the origin of the disease to their marriage.
The woman will often say that for some days
after marriage she suffered with irritation and burning
of the external genitals, with dysuria, perhaps with a
slight vaginal discharge, and that after this, very gradually,
the ovarian pain developed. She may have had one
child or a miscarriage, but with this exception is usually
sterile.</p>

<p>The history of attacks of local peritonitis, confining
the women to bed for several days or weeks, can also usually
be obtained.</p>

<p>The character and the situation of the pain and the
character of the dysmenorrhea usually point strongly to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
salpingitis. The physical examination is not by any
means always satisfactory. The small flaccid tubal tumors
are often difficult to palpate, especially in fat
women, and the gross forms of the disease may be obscured
by surrounding adhesions and inflammation. The
examination, however, when taken in connection with
the history and the symptoms, will usually enable one to
make the diagnosis. Inflammatory tumors in the female
pelvis are very generally tubal in origin.</p>

<p>It is difficult to estimate the mortality of salpingitis.
It is certainly a frequent cause of death&mdash;not only immediately,
by some of the acute accidents that may occur,
but as a result of gradual exhaustion from prolonged suppuration.
Acute salpingitis, and the purulent forms of
the disease, should always be viewed with anxiety. As
appendicitis is the usual cause of peritonitis in man, so is
salpingitis the usual cause of this disease in the woman.
In every case of peritonitis in a woman, therefore, careful
examination of the pelvic organs should be made.</p>

<p>Salpingitis is an exceedingly common disease. It occurs
in all classes of society, but most frequently in the
lower walks of life. Salpingitis is the rule in prostitutes,
and in them is caused by gonorrhea or by septic infection
at criminal abortion.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;The treatment of acute salpingitis in its
early stage should be expectant: absolute rest in the
recumbent position, vaginal douches of a gallon of hot
sterile water (100°-110° F.) two or three times a day,
small doses of saline purgatives (Rochelle salts, ʒss-ʒj
every one or two hours) until mild purgation is produced,
should be prescribed, and should be continued as required.
Relief of pain is afforded by hot fomentations
over the lower abdomen. It is best to administer no
opium, as it is very important to watch these cases closely,
and the symptoms that demand operation might be
masked by the administration of an anodyne. Examinations
should be made with great care and gentleness, and
no oftener than is necessary to determine the progress of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
the disease. If the patient is progressing satisfactorily,
repeated examinations are contraindicated.</p>

<p>A chill followed by a rapid high elevation of temperature
(105°-106° F.) is often caused by even gentle manipulation
of the upper organs of generation in cases of
acute inflammation.</p>

<p>The case must be watched carefully and continuously.
In the gonorrheal and septic forms of the disease there is
great danger of extension to the peritoneum, or of the
formation of a tubal or other form of pelvic abscess that
will imperil the life of the woman.</p>

<p>As a general rule, it may be said that, unless there are
well-marked symptoms of extensive pelvic peritonitis,
or unless a distinct tumor can be felt in the pelvis, operation
is not indicated. As resolution undoubtedly takes
place even after severe acute attacks of salpingitis, it is
right to treat the woman with this end in view rather
than to resort to an immediate mutilating operation.</p>

<p>If, under the expectant plan of treatment, the patient
does not improve; if the area of pelvic tenderness increases;
if the local tympany (which may at first be
present only on one or both sides of the pelvis, and
which indicates merely local peritoneal irritation or inflammation)
extends upward; if the temperature and
pulse-rate increase; if constipation appears; if, in fact,
indications of extension of the peritonitis are present,&mdash;celiotomy
should be immediately performed. The diseased
tube or tubes should be removed, and, if necessary,
the abdomen should be drained.</p>

<p>Fatal peritonitis sometimes results within three or four
days after the onset of acute salpingitis. As soon, therefore,
as the physician realizes the imminence of this
complication in any case, he should not delay in removing
the source of infection.</p>

<p>The other acute termination of salpingitis, the formation
of an abscess in the pelvis, likewise demands operative
interference. This condition is readily recognized.
The woman has one or more chills. The temperature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
becomes more elevated and the pulse more rapid. The
pelvic tenderness and pain may become more distinctly
localized to one or both ovarian regions. Defecation and
urination increase the pain. Bimanual examination reveals
an exceedingly tender mass, either indurated or
perhaps soft and fluctuating, lying to either side of, or
behind the uterus. The character, upon palpation, of
the mass depends upon the nature and extent of the peritoneal
adhesions that surround it. The diagnosis of a
pelvic abscess resulting from acute salpingitis is usually
easy.</p>

<p>There is some difference of opinion among operators in
regard to the best treatment for this condition. Some
advise evacuation of the abscess by way of the vagina;
others advise celiotomy, with removal of the abscess and
the Fallopian tube that caused it, followed, if necessary,
by abdominal or vaginal drainage. I prefer the latter
method of treatment, for reasons that will appear under
the consideration of the technique of operation.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Chronic Salpingitis.</b>&mdash;Cases of simple
chronic catarrhal salpingitis undoubtedly recover after
the cure of the endometrial disease of which the salpingitis
forms a part. The tube may be restored perfectly
to its normal condition; or there may remain an atrophic
condition of the mucous membrane; or the fimbriæ may
be left somewhat distorted, crumpled, or slightly drawn
within the tube; or there may be a few fine peritoneal
adhesions, like cobwebs, between the distal end of the
tube, the broad ligament, and the ovary. Such slight
lesions may cause no trouble beyond interfering a little
with the fecundity of the woman.</p>

<p>When, however, the adhesions are more extensive,
treatment for their relief may be demanded, even though
all inflammatory action has disappeared from the body of
the uterus and the tubes. Treatment in such cases is
demanded, not to cure the salpingitis or on account of
any danger that threatens the woman’s life, but to relieve
the pain caused by the results of the inflammation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>

<p>It may be necessary to perform celiotomy in order to
free or break up adhesions that bind down the ovary in
an abnormal position, or to liberate an adherent intestine,
or to replace a uterus that has been displaced by the traction
of adhesions.</p>

<p>The degree of suffering experienced by the woman is
the guide in advising such operative interference.</p>

<p>Pelvic massage has been used for the relief of pelvic
adhesions of this kind, the uterus, tubes, and ovaries being
manipulated between the fingers in the vagina and a
hand upon the abdomen. The results of this treatment
have not been encouraging.</p>

<p>In discussing the treatment of chronic salpingitis the
cases may be divided into two classes: those in which
palliative treatment may be followed, and those in which
operation is demanded.</p>

<p>There are a great number of cases of chronic salpingitis
in which there is no gross disease of the tubes, and
in which operation upon the tubes is not immediately
indicated. It is proper in such cases to try milder palliative
treatment first.</p>

<p>Salpingitis is always preceded, and usually accompanied,
by inflammation of the endometrium, and in
every chronic case attention should first be directed to
the cure of the endometritis.</p>

<p>If there is no tubal and ovarian displacement&mdash;that
is, if the ovary is not prolapsed; if the uterus has not
been retroverted; if there are no extensive tubal adhesions;
and if there is no gross disease of the tube, such
as pyosalpinx, hydrosalpinx, hematosalpinx, a thorough
curetting of the uterus, or, if necessary, a trachelorrhaphy
or an amputation of the cervix, will often relieve the
woman of her suffering, and it may not be necessary to
operate for the damaged tubes.</p>

<p>In all such cases, however, the operator must be very
careful to exclude active or purulent tubal disease. If he
overlooks a pyosalpinx, the curettage or the trachelorrhaphy
may be followed by an active peritoneal inflammation
that will destroy the woman.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<p>If there is ovarian or uterine displacement, we cannot
expect relief until these conditions have been treated, and
such treatment usually requires celiotomy.</p>

<p>The pain and dysmenorrhea of chronic tubal disease
may be relieved by rest in the recumbent position during
the menstrual period; by the administration of saline
laxatives (the pain is always increased by constipation);
by vaginal douches of large quantities of hot water (one
gallon at 110° F.) administered two or three times a day
in the recumbent posture; and by applications of Churchill’s
tincture of iodine to the vaginal vault, and the use
of the glycerin tampon. The directions for this treatment
have been given under the preparatory treatment
of laceration of the cervix.</p>

<p>Such treatment is only palliative: it relieves the pain,
but it will not cure well-established chronic salpingitis.</p>

<p>In many cases the woman experiences little, if any,
relief from this treatment. In other cases, though the
pain may be very much relieved while she is taking treatment,
yet it returns as soon as the treatment is stopped,
and she becomes unwilling to lead the life of an invalid
under constant medical care, with but little prospect of
relief until the menopause is reached. It is then necessary
to consider operation.</p>

<p>The second class of cases referred to&mdash;those in which
immediate operation is demanded, and in which it is
dangerous to delay and useless to try the palliative treatment&mdash;includes
a great variety. Such cases are&mdash;the
gross forms of tubal disease, hydrosalpinx, hematosalpinx,
and pyosalpinx; salpingitis with prolapsed and adherent
tube and ovary; salpingitis with retrodisplacement
of the uterus; all the milder forms of salpingitis
which have resisted palliative treatment.</p>

<p>The operative treatment of salpingitis usually demands
celiotomy. Some operators, however, prefer to reach the
uterine appendages by way of the vagina.</p>

<p>The details of the operative technique of salpingo-oöphorectomy
will be given in a subsequent chapter. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
a rule, the operation of celiotomy for salpingitis should
always be immediately preceded by thorough curetting
of the uterus and, if necessary, by trachelorrhaphy or
an amputation of the cervix.</p>

<p>After the abdomen has been opened the operation consists
in freeing adhesions, rendering patulous the abdominal
ostium of the tube, replacing the uterus, and, if
necessary, removing the tube and ovary on one or on
both sides.</p>

<p>Removal of the tubes and ovaries&mdash;salpingo-oöphorectomy&mdash;is
usually necessary. In pyosalpinx this operation
should always be performed. If the woman is young and
is very anxious to have children, every attempt should be
made to save, at any rate, one tube and ovary. Remarkable
cases of conception have occurred after conservative
operations upon badly diseased tubes.</p>

<p>The adhesions about the abdominal ostium may be
broken and the imprisoned fimbriæ freed; or if the ostium
is firmly closed, an incision may be made in the
wall of the tube, the peritoneum stitched to the mucous
coat, and a new ostium produced. In one case conception
followed such an operation in which the ovary was
sutured in the artificial opening made in the tube. Conception
has occurred after both tubes had been amputated
at the uterine cornua.</p>

<p>In all such conservative operations, however, the
woman should be told of the probability of failure and
the probable necessity for a subsequent radical operation.
The successful cases show the possibilities of surgery,
but, unfortunately, they are exceptional. Sterility usually
continues, the pain is usually unrelieved, and a second
radical operation becomes necessary.</p>

<p>Such conservative operations upon badly diseased
tubes should be performed, therefore, only when the
woman is young and anxious for children. Whenever
the abdominal ostium is closed and the ovary is adherent,
it is safest to perform a complete salpingo-oöphorectomy.
This is always indicated when the woman is near the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
menopause or when immediate certain relief is demanded
from prolonged suffering.</p>

<p>In some cases the question arises as to whether both
tubes should be removed when only one is grossly diseased.
In the early stages of chronic pyosalpinx it often
happens that but one tube is found diseased, while the
other is apparently perfectly healthy or is only slightly
adherent. Experience has shown that in a great many
cases of tubal disease in which only one tube was removed,
the second tube has become similarly affected,
often within a short time, and a second operation has
been required. This disaster is not likely to occur if the
endometrial disease is eradicated by thorough curetting
at the time of the first operation. But in some forms of
salpingitis, as the gonorrheal, the infection is so deeply
seated in the distal ends of the utricular glands that the
most vigorous curetting fails to remove it, and the second
tube will become infected from the original focus in
the uterus.</p>

<p>So common is such occurrence that many women,
profiting by the experience of their friends, request the
operator to remove both tubes, even though he finds but
one diseased. The advice already given in regard to conservative
operation applies here also. It is safest in all
forms of pyosalpinx to remove both appendages. In the
less serious forms of salpingitis&mdash;hydrosalpinx and adherent
tubes without cystic distention&mdash;there is less danger
of recurrence, and the unilateral operation may be
more safely performed. The importance of thorough
treatment of the endometritis at the same time is emphasized
by these considerations.</p>

<p>In many cases in which double salpingo-oöphorectomy
is performed it is often advisable to remove the uterus at
the same time. The uterus may be amputated at any
convenient point of the cervix, or it may be completely
removed at the vaginal junction. This operation ensures
more certain and speedy relief from suffering, and is
attended by but little, if any, greater mortality than the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
simple salpingo-oöphorectomy. The uterus without the
tubes and ovaries is a useless structure. The operation
is advisable if the uterus is retroverted and adherent,
when the uterus is large and subinvoluted, when the disease
of the endometrium is severe and is likely to persist&mdash;in
any case, in fact, in which the physician fears that
the uterus may be a subsequent source of trouble.</p>

<h4 id="SUPPURATION_OF_THE_PELVIC_CELLULAR_TISSUE">SUPPURATION OF THE PELVIC CELLULAR TISSUE.</h4>

<p>Pus in the female pelvis, to which condition the vague
term of pelvic abscess has been applied, is usually the
result of salpingitis producing a pyosalpinx, of ovarian
abscess, or of suppuration of an ovarian cyst, very often
a dermoid. The disease may also occur from infection
of a broad-ligament hematoma or from a pelvic hematocele
caused by a ruptured tubal pregnancy.</p>

<p>Following these conditions the cellular tissue of the
pelvis may become affected, so that the purulent accumulation
may make its way between the layers of the
broad ligament or in some other part of the pelvis.</p>

<p>Before the days of modern abdominal surgery these
accumulations of pus were evacuated through the vagina,
the rectum, or the abdominal wall, according to the direction
in which the abscess seemed to point or in which it
seemed to be most accessible. The sinuses thus formed
often persisted for years or during the remaining life of
the woman. There were many theories in regard to the
origin of the suppuration, it being impossible to determine
its true nature without opening the abdomen.
Now we know that the great majority of such pelvic
abscesses originated in septic infection of the Fallopian
tubes, and that infection of the pelvic cellular tissue
was secondary.</p>

<p>There are, however, rare cases in which the suppuration
occurs primarily in the cellular tissue of the pelvis,
without any involvement whatever of the tubes or
ovaries. Such an accumulation of pus is usually found
in the cellular tissue of the broad ligaments; it sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
occurs in the utero-vesical tissue, and rarely in the
tissue back of the cervical neck.</p>

<p>The cause of such suppuration is usually infection, by
way of the lymphatics, from the uterus, or by the passage
of septic organisms directly through the uterine wall.
The condition is most frequently the result of puerperal
sepsis. I have on one occasion seen it occur in connection
with extensive venereal ulceration of the external
genitals. It seems probable that a pelvic lymphatic
gland, becoming infected, may break down and suppurate,
forming the starting-point of the abscess.</p>

<p>The symptoms of this form of pelvic abscess are those
characteristic of any other kind of suppuration in the
pelvis.</p>

<p>The purulent accumulation may be detected by bimanual
examination. It usually bulges into the vagina
at the lateral fornices or before or behind the cervix.
The abscess-mass is in close relationship with the uterus.
In this respect it differs from a simple tubal or an ovarian
abscess, in which cases a distinct separation of the tubal
or ovarian tumor from the uterus may be determined, at
any rate, before the pelvic cellular tissue has become involved.</p>

<p>If the abscess bulge in the anterior vaginal fornix, it
is very probably of neither tubal nor ovarian origin, as
tubal and ovarian abscesses lie to the side of, or behind,
the uterus.</p>

<p>The sense of fluctuation is often difficult or impossible
to determine. The infiltration of the surrounding structures
gives to the mass a dense hard feeling that obscures
fluctuation. To the experienced finger, however, this
indurated condition of the tissues is characteristic of
pelvic suppuration, as is the sense of fluctuation elsewhere.</p>

<p>The treatment of pelvic suppuration of this nature is
evacuation by way of the vagina. The incision should
be made into the most prominent part of the mass.
When made into the lateral fornices, the operator should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
remember the position of the ureters and the uterine
arteries. The ureters lie a little over half an inch from
the cervix. In every case it is safest to make the incision
close to the cervix and to work carefully into the abscess-cavity.
The pus should be evacuated, and a double drainage-tube
should be introduced for subsequent washing.</p>

<p>In most cases, however, the physician cannot determine
with any certainty that the abscess is simply confined
to the pelvic cellular tissue and did not originate in
the Fallopian tube. If there is any doubt of this kind,
celiotomy should be performed and the true nature of the
condition determined. If a pyosalpinx or an ovarian
abscess is present, as is usually the case, the condition
may be dealt with as has already been advised. If the uterine
adnexa are healthy, the abdomen may be closed and
a subsequent vaginal incision may be made.</p>

<p>Indiscriminate evacuation of collections of pus in the
pelvis by way of the vagina has resulted in a great deal
of harm. The abscess, being usually of tubal origin,
often persists indefinitely. Intestine, ureters, bladder,
and blood-vessels have often been injured; and when subsequent
celiotomy is performed the operation is attended
with great danger from the presence of the fistulous
opening.

<h3 id="DISEASES_OF_THE_FALLOPIAN_TUBES_CONTINUED">DISEASES OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES (Continued).</h3>

<h4 id="TUBERCULOSIS">TUBERCULOSIS.</h4>

<p>Tuberculosis attacks the Fallopian tubes much more
frequently than any other part of the genital apparatus.
The disease may be associated with tuberculosis of the
peritoneum or with tuberculosis of the ovaries and the
uterus. As has already been said, tuberculosis of the
uterus often originates in the tubes and extends thence to
the endometrium.</p>

<p>The tubercular Fallopian tube varies much in appearance
according to the nature and stage of the disease.
The strictly tubercular lesions may be masked by those
of ordinary inflammation. There may be peritoneal adhesions,
often very dense and widespread, between the
tube and adjacent organs, and the ostium abdominale
may be closed, as in non-tubercular salpingitis.</p>

<p>In some cases these simple inflammatory adhesions
probably existed before the tubercular infection took
place, the tuberculosis occurring in an old diseased tube.
In other cases it is probable that the inflammatory adhesions
and products occurred as a result of the tuberculosis,
which attacked a tube previously healthy. In
the latter case such adhesions may be viewed as a conservative
process.</p>

<p>The tubercular tube is often very much enlarged from
infiltration of its walls and dilatation of its lumen. It
may be filled with typical caseous material, and when
this is removed the mucous membrane will be found the
seat of deep, jagged, ulcerated areas.</p>

<p>If the abdominal ostium is not entirely closed, the
cheesy material may project into the abdominal cavity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
If the disease has extended to the peritoneal coat, the
covering of the tube will be found studded with typical
tubercles (<a href="#fig_152">Fig. 152</a>). Such tuberculosis of the peritoneum
may be confined to that covering the tube, or it
may extend to the uterus and throughout the abdominal
cavity.</p>

<p>In peritoneal tuberculosis that has originated in the
tube the lesions are found to be most widespread in the
pelvic peritoneum.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_152" src="images/fig_152.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 152.</span>&mdash;Tuberculosis of the Fallopian tubes. The disease has extended to
the peritoneum, which is covered with tubercles.</p></div>

<p>In some cases the ostium becomes closed, and the tubes
are found distended with pus, forming tubercular pyosalpinx.
Such tubes sometimes attain enormous size,
containing a quart or more of purulent material.</p>

<p>In less extreme cases than those just described the tubercular
area may be limited to a portion of the tube,
and gives rise to one or more nodular enlargements (<a href="#fig_153">Fig.
153</a>). In other cases there is no gross change in the shape
or size of the tube, and only a few miliary tubercles are
found scattered throughout the mucous membrane.</p>

<p>In a very large number of the cases of tuberculosis of
the Fallopian tubes, the lesions resemble in all respects
those of ordinary salpingitis, and are not in any way recognizable
by the naked eye as characteristic of tuberculosis.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
There are no cheesy contents; there are no tubercles
upon the peritoneum; the mucous membrane
shows no macroscopical changes that would lead to the
suspicion of tuberculosis. In these cases the tubes are
usually closed at the abdominal ostium; there may or
may not be cystic distention; and the adhesions, which
are usually very firm, distort the shape of the tube and
bind it to the posterior aspect of the broad ligament,
the uterus, or other pelvic structure. Until recent years
such cases were supposed to be simple cases of salpingitis.
Careful microscopic examination, however, has
shown that this forms one variety of tubal tuberculosis,
and that a certain proportion of such cases of salpingitis
are tubercular. The term “unsuspected tuberculosis”
has been applied by Williams to such cases.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_153" src="images/fig_153.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 153.</span>&mdash;Tuberculosis of the Fallopian tubes: <i>A</i>, tubercular nodules.</p></div>

<p>Cases of tuberculosis of the Fallopian tubes may be
divided into three classes: Miliary tuberculosis; chronic
diffuse tuberculosis (cheesy tubes); and chronic fibroid
tuberculosis.</p>

<p><i>Miliary tuberculosis</i> of the tubes may be a part of a
general miliary tuberculosis, or it may occur primarily
in the tube. Microscopic examination shows giant epithelioid
cell-tubercles scattered throughout the mucous
membrane.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

<p>Miliary tuberculosis is the first stage of tuberculosis of
the tubes. The process may progress no farther, or it
may become converted into one of the other varieties.</p>

<p>In <i>chronic diffuse tuberculosis</i> the mucous membrane is
infiltrated with epithelioid cells, miliary tubercles, and
areas of caseation. The tube may be filled with cheesy
material or with pus, and in time the mucous membrane
becomes completely destroyed. In this form of tuberculosis
the gross appearances are usually characteristic, and
are those which have already been described.</p>

<p>In <i>chronic fibroid tuberculosis</i> there is a great increase
of connective tissue between the tubercles. The lumen
of the tube is distorted, and a few miliary tubercles are
found scattered through the mucous membrane. This
form of the disease is very slow and chronic, and represents
a usual method of spontaneous cure.</p>

<p>Since the discovery of so-called unsuspected tuberculosis
of the Fallopian tubes the disease has been found
to be much more frequent than was formerly supposed.</p>

<p>Williams found tuberculosis of the tubes in one out of
every twelve operations for the removal of tubes and
ovaries that were the seat of past or present inflammatory
disease.</p>

<p>Dr. Beyea and I have found tuberculosis of the tubes
present in 18 per cent. of the cases that were subjected to
the operation of salpingo-oöphorectomy for inflammatory
disease of the tubes.</p>

<p>It may be said, therefore, that tuberculosis is present
in from 8 to 18 per cent. of all cases of inflammatory
disease of the uterine appendages. It is impossible,
however, to say whether or not tuberculosis is the cause
of the disease in all cases, or whether tuberculosis has
been grafted upon a previous non-tubercular affection.
Other organisms, along with the tubercle bacillus, are
frequently found in the Fallopian tube.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis of the Fallopian tubes may be primary
or secondary.</p>

<p>In primary tuberculosis the tubes are the primary seat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
of the disease, being affected before other structures of
the body.</p>

<p>In secondary tuberculosis the tubes are affected from a
tubercular focus in some other part of the body.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis of the tubes is usually secondary.</p>

<p>Infection takes place in a variety of ways. Infection
through the blood is the most usual way.</p>

<p>Infection may take place from a tubercular ulcer of the
intestine or bladder becoming adherent to the tube. The
tube may become involved by extension of tuberculosis
of the peritoneum to it. In many cases the reverse order
happens: the tube is first involved by the tuberculosis,
and the disease extends thence to the peritoneum. In
other cases it is the peritoneum that is primarily affected.
It seems probable that tubercle bacilli, having gained
entrance to the peritoneum from a tuberculous mesenteric
gland or from an intestinal ulceration, fall to the
pelvis and are drawn into the Fallopian tubes, there
producing tuberculous lesions without first affecting the
peritoneum.</p>

<p>It seems probable that in a good many cases of tuberculosis
of the tubes the infection takes place from without
by way of the genital tract. Dirty instruments,
syringes, or the examining finger may cause it in this
way. Infection may also occur from clothing or bed-sheets
soiled by sputum or other tubercular discharge.
Coitus with men affected with genito-urinary tuberculosis
or any other form of tuberculosis may be an occasional
cause. It has been shown that tubercle bacilli may be
present in the testes and prostate glands of consumptives
without any evidence of genito-urinary tuberculosis being
present.</p>

<p>Tubal tuberculosis may occur by way of the genital
tract from infection from the discharges from some other
tubercular focus in the woman, as in the lungs, bladder,
or intestinal tract.</p>

<p>The <b>symptoms</b> of tuberculosis of the Fallopian tubes
are not at all characteristic. Most cases of tubal tuberculosis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
have been discovered at the autopsy or have been
unexpectedly found at operation.</p>

<p>The symptoms resemble those of non-tubercular salpingitis.
There is the same ovarian pain and dysmenorrhea.
Bimanual examination reveals the enlarged or
nodular and distorted condition of the tube. The adhesions
are often very firm and dense, and the tubal tumor
is often of stony hardness.</p>

<p>The <b>diagnosis</b> of uncomplicated tubal tuberculosis is
difficult, and in many cases impossible. If the peritoneal
covering of the tube is involved, the small tubercles may
sometimes be felt by vaginal or rectal palpation. Or, if
the condition has extended to the posterior aspect of the
uterus, the tubercles may be felt here, by dragging the
cervix down with a tenaculum and palpating the posterior
uterine surface with a finger in the vagina or the
rectum. The association of salpingitis with pulmonary
tuberculosis would lead the physician to suspect that the
salpingitis might be tubercular. If the woman has tuberculosis
of the peritoneum, and the tubes are found enlarged,
it is most probable that they are tubercular. A
knowledge of a genito-urinary lesion of tubercular nature
in the husband should lead us to fear tubal tuberculosis
in the wife.</p>

<p><b>Prognosis.</b>&mdash;Tubal tuberculosis is a dangerous disease.
There are several methods of termination. It very often
leads to tuberculosis of the peritoneum. For this reason
peritoneal tuberculosis is more common in women than
in men.</p>

<p>A tubercular abscess may be formed in the pelvis, and
the woman may die as the result of prolonged discharge
and suppuration, as in the case of non-tubercular pyosalpinx.
General tubercular infection may arise from
the tubercular focus in the tubes.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis of the tubes may, and probably often
does, undergo spontaneous cure. The fibroid changes
that have been described lead to this end. In some cases
calcification occurs, as in tuberculosis elsewhere, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
disease is cured in this way. <a href="#fig_154">Fig. 154</a> represents an old
tubercular pyosalpinx that was filled with calcified plates.</p>

<p>Even though these conservative changes take place and
all danger from the tuberculosis has disappeared, the
woman will continue to suffer pain and dysmenorrhea
from the tubal and ovarian adhesions.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;The treatment of tubal tuberculosis is
celiotomy, with removal of the tubes and ovaries. If
the uterus is involved, it should also be removed. Removal
of the tubes, however, is the important feature of
the operation. I have seen perfect and permanent recovery
occur after removing the tubes, even though the
disease had extended into the uterine cornua. As the disease
very rarely extends below the internal os, the uterus
may be amputated at any convenient point of the cervix.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_154" src="images/fig_154.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 154.</span>&mdash;A tubercular pyosalpinx. To the left are three calcified plates that
were found in the tube.</p></div>

<p>Tuberculosis of the peritoneum is an indication for,
rather than a contraindication to, the operation. The
most extensive cases of peritoneal tuberculosis have been
cured by opening and draining the abdomen. If the
tubes are rendered inaccessible from the involvement of
surrounding structures, the operator must content himself
with opening and draining the abdomen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<p><b id="ADENOMA">Adenoma</b> of the Fallopian tube is a rare disease; but
a few cases have been described in medical records. The
presence of primary adenoma in the Fallopian tube is
strong proof of the glandular character of the mucous
membrane&mdash;an anatomical point which, as has already
been said, has been denied by some writers. In adenoma
the tube becomes distended with the typical adenomatous
mass, which may protrude from the abdominal ostium.</p>

<p>In some of the reported cases there has been found a
considerable quantity of free fluid in the peritoneum,
though the peritoneum itself was not diseased. It seems
probable that this secretion originated in the tube and
escaped at the ostium.</p>

<p><b id="MYOMA">Myoma.</b>&mdash;Notwithstanding the frequency of myomatous
tumors of the uterus, the condition is exceedingly
rare in the Fallopian tubes. The tumors originate in the
muscular coat, and are usually so small as to create no
disturbance.</p>

<p><b id="CANCER">Cancer.</b>&mdash;Primary cancer of the Fallopian tubes is an
extremely rare disease. A very few isolated cases have
been reported.</p>

<p>Cancer of the tubes secondary to cancer of the body
of the uterus occurs more frequently.</p>

<p><b id="SARCOMA">Sarcoma</b> of the tube is a very rare disease.</p>

<p><b id="ACTINOMYCOSIS">Actinomycosis</b> of the Fallopian tubes has been described.</p>

<p><b id="SYPHILITIC_GUMMATA">Syphilitic gummata</b> occasionally attack the Fallopian
tube in women who are the victims of constitutional
syphilis.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of these unusual lesions of the Fallopian
tubes is impossible with our present knowledge. The
conditions have usually been found post-mortem or have
been unexpectedly discovered at operation. The subjective
symptoms throw no light upon the subject of differential
diagnosis. Examination reveals merely a tubal
tumor.</p>

<p>As the rule is to operate in all cases of tubal tumor,
the proper treatment will probably be applied, notwithstanding
the uncertainty or mistake of diagnosis.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3 id="TUBAL_PREGNANCY">TUBAL PREGNANCY.</h3>

<p>Tubal pregnancy occurs when a fecundated ovum is
developed in the Fallopian tube.</p>

<p>Fecundation may take place in the Fallopian tube, because
spermatozoa may pass through the uterus and the
tube into the pelvic cavity; but unless something occurs
to arrest the passage of the fertilized ovum into the
uterus, a normal uterine pregnancy will result. It is said
by Webster that predisposition to tubal pregnancy is due
to a “developmental fault, whereby there is reversion,
either of structure or reaction tendency, in the tubal
mucosa to an earlier type in mammalian evolution.”</p>

<p>In other words, decidual changes, following the fertilization
of the ovum, may in some women occur in the
mucous membrane of the Fallopian tubes as well as in
that of the uterus. If this condition is present in any
case, and at the same time something occurs to impede
the passage of the ovum into the uterus, a tubal pregnancy
may take place.</p>

<p>Interference with the passage of the ovum along the
tube has been attributed to a variety of causes. Chronic
salpingitis is a frequent cause. It destroys the cilia of
the epithelial cells of the tubal mucosa. It produces
thickening of the tubal walls, and causes peritoneal
adhesions that impede the normal peristaltic action of
the tube.</p>

<p>Obstruction to the passage of the ovum may also be
caused by polypi or tumors of the tube; by tumors external
to the tube pressing upon it; by displacement and
hernia of the tube; by diverticula of the tube; or by abnormal
foldings of the tubal wall. Tubal pregnancy has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
occurred in tubes in which no lesions whatever could be
discovered by the most careful examination.</p>

<p>It seems probable that practically all pregnancies that
occur outside of the uterus originate in the Fallopian tube.</p>

<p>Pregnancy may occur in any part of the tube from the
abdominal ostium to the uterus.</p>

<p>Tubal pregnancy is said to be infundibular when gestation
begins in the infundibulum or in an accessory tube-ending.
This variety has also been called tubo-ovarian,
because in time the gestation-sac may become adherent
to the ovary and be bounded by both tube and ovary.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_155" src="images/fig_155.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 155.</span>&mdash;Tubal pregnancy, removed before rupture. The opening that has
been cut in the tube shows the chorionic villi.</p></div>

<p>The pregnancy is said to be ampullar when gestation begins
in the ampulla of the tube. This is the most usual
seat of tubal pregnancy. It is called interstitial when
gestation begins in the interstitial portion, or that part of
the tube in immediate relationship with the uterus.</p>

<p><b>Changes in the Fallopian Tube.</b>&mdash;During the early
stages of tubal pregnancy&mdash;the first two or three months&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
seems probable that a certain amount of hypertrophy
and hyperplasia of the muscular wall of the tube takes
place. The general form of the tube is spindle-shaped
(<a href="#fig_155">Fig. 155</a>). There is a marked increase in the vascularity
of the tube, most pronounced in the neighborhood of the
ovum. The whole tube becomes turgid and swollen.
The peritoneal margin or ring surrounding the ostium
abdominale becomes prominent, and gradually, as has
already been described under Salpingitis, projects beyond
the fimbriæ, contracts, and ultimately hermetically closes
the ostium.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the peritoneal covering of the tube
may be present. Such inflammation may have preceded
the tubal pregnancy or may have occurred as the result
of the pregnancy. It produces various tubal adhesions
and distortions, and may still more firmly close the abdominal
ostium. The changes that take place in the
mucous membrane of the tube and in the developing
ovum are similar to those that occur in the uterus in a
normal pregnancy.</p>

<p>A variety of terminations occur in tubal pregnancy:</p>

<p>I. In very exceptional cases the pregnancy may continue
until full term, without rupture of the tube taking
place.</p>

<p>II. The tube may rupture. This is by far the most
usual occurrence. The rupture may take place into the
broad ligament, into the peritoneal cavity, or, in the case
of interstitial tubal pregnancy, into the uterus.</p>

<p>III. Tubal abortion may occur, the ovum being discharged
through the abdominal ostium into the peritoneal
cavity.</p>

<p>IV. The ovum may be destroyed in the tube, gestation
being stopped before rupture takes place.</p>

<p>Rupture of the tube is the rule in tubal pregnancy.
The time of rupture depends upon the position of the
ovum in the tube. It occurs somewhat later in the interstitial
variety than when the ovum is situated in the free
portion of the tube. Rupture in interstitial pregnancy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
commonly occurs before the fifth month. In the other
forms of tubal pregnancy it occurs most usually before
the end of the third month. In the latter class of cases
the greatest number of ruptures occur during the second
month.</p>

<p>Rupture is caused by the gradual thinning of the tube
from distention. Rupture may take place suddenly, a
large hole, through which the ovum escapes, being produced;
or the rupture and discharge of the ovum may
take place gradually without causing any acute symptoms.</p>

<p>When the rupture takes place between the layers of
the broad ligament, the hemorrhage is usually not very
profuse, as it is controlled by pressure of the structures
that surround the blood. A broad-ligament hematoma
is formed. The ovum may be destroyed as a result of
the rupture, and no further lesions due to the development
of gestation will arise. The hematoma, with the
ovum, may in time be absorbed; or suppuration may occur,
with the production of a pelvic abscess; or mummification,
adipoceration, or lithopedion formation may take
place in the fetus.</p>

<p>If the ovum is not destroyed by the rupture, it may continue
to develop in the cavity formed by the tube and the
broad ligament. The placenta may remain attached to
the inner surface of the tube, or it may contract adventitious
attachments to any of the surrounding structures&mdash;the
surface of the uterus and the pelvic floor. The cavity
occupied by the ovum may continue to enlarge, by the
pushing aside of pelvic and abdominal organs, until full
term is reached and spurious labor comes on.</p>

<p>In some cases a secondary rupture of the gestation-sac
occurs, and the fetus is discharged into the peritoneal
cavity.</p>

<p>When rupture of the tube into the peritoneal cavity
occurs, the danger of fatal hemorrhage is very great.
The majority of women die within forty-eight hours after
this accident, unless relieved by immediate laparotomy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
There is no surrounding pressure to control the hemorrhage,
as in the case of rupture into the broad ligament.
Sometimes the escaping ovum plugs the rent in the tube,
and bleeding is checked in this way.</p>

<p>If the woman survive the effects of hemorrhage, she
may die from peritonitis or from suppuration of the hematocele
in the peritoneal cavity.</p>

<p>In exceptional cases, if the pregnancy be early, the
blood and the ovum may be absorbed by the peritoneum,
and spontaneous recovery occurs.</p>

<p>If the woman is not destroyed by the first effects of
the rupture, the fetus, surrounded by its membranes,
may escape into the peritoneal cavity, while the placenta
may remain attached to the tube and gestation may continue.
It is very doubtful whether the fetus will continue
to live if it escapes into the peritoneum free of the membranes.
There is no evidence that an early ovum may
escape into the cavity of the abdomen and develop on the
peritoneum.</p>

<p>If the fetus does not survive, it may be absorbed by the
peritoneum or mummification may occur.</p>

<p><i>Tubal abortion</i> means the separation of the ovum from
the tube-wall, and its partial or complete discharge
through the ostium abdominale into the peritoneal cavity.
The accident is accompanied by hemorrhage into
the tube and thence into the peritoneal cavity.</p>

<p>Tubal abortion is most likely to occur during the early
weeks of pregnancy (the first and the second months),
before the abdominal ostium has become closed.</p>

<p>It is probable that tubal abortion is much more frequent
than is generally supposed. According to Sutton,
tubal abortion was probably the cause of the peritoneal
hematocele in many cases in which the bleeding was
attributed to other origin, as reflux of menstrual blood
from the uterus and simple hemorrhage from the tube.</p>

<p>In tubal abortion the loss of blood into the peritoneum
may be so great that the woman is destroyed. In other
cases death results from peritonitis and suppuration of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
the hematocele. And, finally, in a good many cases the
blood and ovum may be absorbed, and recovery takes
place. Sometimes, at operation, the ovum is found in
the peritoneal cavity without any blood. The blood had
either been small in amount and quickly absorbed, or
there had been no escape of blood into the peritoneum.
Blood-clot is usually found in the Fallopian tube after
tubal abortion. The ostium may become closed and a
hematosalpinx may result.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_156" src="images/fig_156.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 156.</span>&mdash;Extra-uterine pregnancy; tubal abortion. The bleeding is checked by a large
coagulum distending and thinning out the tube; the fimbriated opening is greatly distended,

<p>When the ovum is destroyed in the tube before rupture
takes place, the fetus and the blood may be absorbed; or
mummification, adipoceration, or lithopedion-formation
may result; or suppuration may occur, with the formation
of a pyosalpinx; or, if death of the fetus happens in
the early weeks, the tube may be found closed at the
ostium abdominale, and filled with blood in which no
fetus may be detected. Such cases have been repeatedly
described as hematosalpinx, the real origin of the condition
in pregnancy not being known. The fetus had been
absorbed or broken up and scattered through the blood-mass.
Careful microscopic examination of the tube reveals
the true condition&mdash;a destroyed tubal pregnancy
with hemorrhage into the tube. As has already been
said, hematosalpinx not caused by tubal pregnancy is
very rare.</p>

<p>Coincidently with the development of the tubal pregnancy
there occur enlargement of the body of the uterus
and decidual transformation of the endometrium. The
decidual membrane separates, entire or in fragments, and
is discharged from the uterus, after the death of the
embryo or during its development, from the eighth to
the tenth week. The decidua again forms only when
gestation continues undisturbed.</p>

<p>The enlargement of the uterus varies a great deal according
to the position of the tubal pregnancy and the
course of its development. The interstitial variety is accompanied
by the greatest uterine enlargement. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
the tubal gestation has reached full time the uterus may
measure from 4 to 7½ inches in length.</p>

<p>The increased size of the uterus is most marked in the
long diameter. The change of shape does not resemble
that which occurs in normal pregnancy.</p>

<p>The uterus also becomes softer in tubal pregnancy, and
the cervix softens somewhat, though not so much as in a
uterine pregnancy.</p>

<p>If the woman and the fetus survive the many dangers
that accompany the progress of tubal gestation, the
development of the fetus will go on to full term, and
then the phenomenon of spurious labor will come on.</p>

<p>In spurious labor there are a series of periodical pains
that resemble those of normal labor. The pains may last
from a few hours to several days. They may cease, and
reappear after varying intervals.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage usually takes place from the uterus. After
the spurious labor the uterine discharge may be of the
same character as that seen after normal labor.</p>

<p>It is probable that the fetus always dies after spurious
labor. The liquor amnii is absorbed, the gestation-sac
shrinks, and changes take place in the fetus similar to
those already referred to. It may become mummified or
converted into adipocere or a lithopedion. In this condition
it may remain in the abdomen for many years. A
mummified fetus that had been carried for fifty years has
been removed post-mortem from a woman aged eighty-two.</p>

<p>Rarely, after spurious labor the gestation-sac ruptures
and the fetus is discharged into the peritoneum, the vagina,
or the large intestine, whence it is born through
the anus.</p>

<p>The <b>symptoms</b> of tubal pregnancy are in some cases
similar in all respects to those of normal uterine pregnancy.
In extremely rare cases the woman has reached
full term in ignorance of any unusual condition. Usually,
however, the early occurrence of some of the accidents
of tubal gestation attracts her attention. Before such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
accidents or complications arise there are most frequently
no subjective symptoms to excite any suspicion of the
peculiar form of pregnancy. Changes in the skin, in the
nipples, in the nervous and circulatory systems, and in
the gastro-intestinal tract may resemble those of normal
pregnancy, and are subject to the same variations.</p>

<p>Mammary changes accompanied by the secretion of
milk occur in tubal pregnancy. These changes are,
however, less pronounced than in uterine gestation. The
vagina may undergo changes similar to those of normal
pregnancy; it becomes soft, relaxed, and altered in color,
and pulsation of vessels may be felt in the walls.</p>

<p>It should always be remembered, however, that tubal
pregnancy may occur without the presence of any of the
signs of pregnancy. Women in perfect health, thoughtless
of pregnancy, have died of acute hemorrhage from a
ruptured tubal gestation&mdash;the first symptom of this condition.</p>

<p>The changes in menstruation vary a great deal. Menstruation
usually ceases when tubal pregnancy begins,
though not with the same regularity as in normal pregnancy.</p>

<p>Sometimes menstruation continues for a few months
and then ceases. In other cases menstruation is arrested
for the first few months, and occurs with greater or less
regularity during the latter months of pregnancy. There
may be an irregular discharge of blood throughout the
whole course of gestation.</p>

<p>In the blood discharged from the uterus there may often
be found pieces of decidual tissue of various size. Sometimes
the whole decidual membrane of the uterus may
be expelled in one mass. In any suspected case the blood
should always be carefully examined for such decidual
membrane. All shreds of tissue should be submitted to
careful microscopic examination. The woman should be
questioned in regard to the passage of such tissue before
she came under medical supervision.</p>

<p>The woman often complains of periodical pains occurring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
in the hypogastrium and in the pregnant tube.
They usually appear after the second month, though they
may begin earlier. These pains are thought to be caused
by the contractions of the uterus and the gestation-sac.</p>

<p>The abdominal enlargement in extra-uterine pregnancy
differs in several respects from that of normal pregnancy.
It is usually most marked on one side of the abdomen,
especially during the first five or six months.</p>

<p>Toward the end of gestation the enlargement becomes
more symmetrical in the abdomen, and resembles closely
that of normal pregnancy.</p>

<p>In tubal gestation, on account of the higher position
of the tube, bulging of the abdominal wall is likely to
appear somewhat earlier than in normal pregnancy. The
abdominal enlargement in tubal pregnancy does not follow
the same uniform progress that is characteristic of
uterine pregnancy.</p>

<p>Fetal movements take place, and fetal heart-sounds are
heard as in normal pregnancy.</p>

<p>Bimanual examination made before rupture of the tube
will reveal the tubal enlargement, the shape of the tube
depending, of course, upon the position of the tubal
pregnancy. The tubal enlargement is said by Veit to
have a characteristic soft feel, distinct from the hard or
fluctuating enlargements of other forms of tubal disease.</p>

<p>After rupture the distinct tubal tumor disappears, and
the examiner feels a mass lying to one side of or behind
the uterus. The enlarged tube may be felt merged in
this mass.</p>

<p>If pregnancy continues after rupture, the fetal movements
may be felt and ballottement may be obtained. The
cervix is found to be somewhat softened; the os may be
patulous; the uterus is soft and enlarged. The uterine
enlargement, however, is not of the same rounded shape
as the pregnant uterus, and the size is much less than
that of corresponding periods of normal pregnancy.</p>

<p>It is of great importance to study the symptoms of the
accidents of tubal pregnancy. As has already been said,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
it is usually the accident of rupture that first directs the
woman’s attention to the abnormal condition.</p>

<p>The symptoms depend upon the seat of rupture. Rupture
of the tube into the broad ligament is a much less
serious accident than rupture into the peritoneal cavity.</p>

<p>If the rupture into the broad ligament is sudden, the
woman complains of sudden acute pain in the affected
side. The pain may extend to the back and throughout
the pelvis. The intensity and extent of the pain depend
on the amount of blood that escapes. Sometimes only a
small hematoma is found in the broad ligament; at other
times the blood burrows around the rectum, and symptoms
of pressure may arise. Difficult defecation may
follow. Retention of urine may occur.</p>

<p>The woman suffers from shock, and may become somewhat
anemic.</p>

<p>Bimanual examination reveals the condition. The
broad ligament will be found filled with a tense mass that
bulges into the vagina. The uterus is pushed to one side.
The mass may extend behind the uterus and surround
the rectum. The upper outlines felt by the abdominal
hand are ill defined.</p>

<p>The loss of blood from simple rupture into the broad
ligament is not often sufficient to cause death. The fetus
may continue to develop, however, and secondary rupture
into the peritoneal cavity may occur.</p>

<p>Rupture of the tube or of the gestation-sac into the
peritoneal cavity is a very fatal occurrence. In the
majority of cases death from hemorrhage occurs within
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Unless the ovum plugs the rent in the tube, there is
nothing to arrest the hemorrhage.</p>

<p>The woman is seized with sudden pain in the side,
often described as the sensation of “something giving
away.” She suffers from faintness, acute anemia, nausea,
vomiting, and collapse. As in other cases of acute
anemia, there may be delirium and convulsions.</p>

<p>Bimanual examination made after intraperitoneal rupture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
reveals an indefinite fulness or a yielding mass in
the pelvis behind the uterus. The blood free in the
peritoneal cavity coagulates slowly, and the fluid blood
or soft unrestrained clots are often very difficult to palpate.
For this reason, at first the examiner can feel
only an ill-defined fulness in the pelvis. If the woman
survives and the mass of blood becomes more solid, it
may then be distinctly palpated as a solid mass behind
the uterus, bulging into the vagina, and extending up
into the abdomen. Though the hematocele may at first
be difficult to define, yet the enlarged tube may usually
be palpated, and the ovum may sometimes be felt in the
midst of the ill-defined mass of blood.</p>

<p>As has already been said, in rare cases rupture may
occur intraperitoneally or into the broad ligament without
producing any of the severe symptoms just described.
The fetus continues to develop, and the woman will be
ignorant that rupture has ever occurred. Between the
two extremes there are all degrees of severity.</p>

<p>In tubal abortion the symptoms resemble those of
intraperitoneal rupture.</p>

<p>If the fetus dies within the tube, the symptoms become
those of hematosalpinx or other form of tubal
disease.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis.</b>&mdash;The diagnosis of tubal pregnancy is not
often made before rupture, because there are usually no
symptoms that direct the woman’s attention to the abnormality
of her condition. Very often she thinks that
she is normally pregnant.</p>

<p>If opportunity is given for examination before rupture,
the diagnosis may sometimes be made. The
woman presents the signs of pregnancy. The uterus
may be slightly enlarged, though not of the size or
shape normal for the stage of pregnancy. There is
a soft tubal tumor.</p>

<p>Immediately after rupture the diagnosis of the condition
must be made from a study of the previous history,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
from the present subjective symptoms, and by bimanual
examination.</p>

<p>If a woman who had thought herself pregnant is suddenly
seized with pain in the side, followed by anemia
and shock, the suspicion of extra-uterine pregnancy
should be aroused. If bimanual examination reveals
the hematoma or hematocele in the pelvis, with tubal
enlargement, the diagnosis may be made. Pelvic hematoma
and hematocele are in nearly all cases caused by
tubal pregnancy.</p>

<p>If the woman survives the rupture and the fetus continues
to develop, the diagnosis becomes easier the more
advanced is the case.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that amenorrhea is not as
general in tubal as in uterine pregnancy. The woman
often gives the history of irregular bleeding, or of arrest
for a few periods and then recurrence of menstruation.
Such experience may lead her to seek medical advice
even before rupture.</p>

<p>The intermitting attacks of pain that are sometimes
felt in the affected tube may also cause her to seek medical
advice.</p>

<p>A history of the discharge of membrane or of shreds
of membrane is of great value. If opportunity is afforded
for examination of such shreds, and decidual cells are
found, and if uterine pregnancy may be excluded, there
is very strong evidence that any mass in the pelvis is an
extra-uterine gestation.</p>

<p>It has been advised to curette the uterus for diagnosis
in order to determine the decidual character of the lining
membrane. This is good advice if the operation is performed
with great care and if we can with certainty exclude
the possibility of uterine pregnancy. If followed
indiscriminately, numbers of abortions would be produced.
Uterine pregnancy has often been mistaken for
tubal pregnancy. The mistake is likely to occur when
the fundus is drawn to one side or is retroflexed. Uterine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
pregnancy may occur with tubal enlargement from other
cause than tubal pregnancy.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the diagnosis of tubal pregnancy before
the presence of a fetus can be ascertained is based on the
following considerations: The symptoms of pregnancy;
a tubal or pelvic tumor; a slightly enlarged though not
pregnant uterus; discharge of decidual tissue from the
uterus; the history of the woman pointing to menstrual
irregularity, uterine discharge of shreds, history of previous
tubal rupture.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;The treatment of tubal pregnancy is
operative. It may be considered under the following
heads: Before primary rupture; At the time of rupture;
After rupture.</p>

<p><i>Before Primary Rupture.</i>&mdash;If the physician is so fortunate
as to recognize a tubal pregnancy before primary
rupture, he should without delay remove the affected
tube and the contained ovum. The operation is simple,
is attended by no more danger than that accompanying
an ordinary salpingo-oöphorectomy, and the woman is
saved the imminent dangers associated with a developing
tubal pregnancy. There are no circumstances under
which it is proper to follow an expectant treatment.</p>

<p>Most of the cases of unruptured tubal pregnancy that
have been operated upon were not recognized until the
abdomen had been opened. The operation was performed
under the diagnosis of pyosalpinx, hematosalpinx,
or some other tubal disease. The cases show the
value of the general rule to operate without delay for
all gross diseases of the tubes.</p>

<p><i>At the Time of Rupture.</i>&mdash;Many cases of tubal pregnancy
are first seen at the time of rupture. In such cases
celiotomy should be performed without delay. The condition
is most urgent in intraperitoneal rupture, but it is
the safest rule to operate immediately, whether the rupture
be intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal. It is unwise
to wait for reaction. The physical depression in such
cases is due more to hemorrhage than to shock, and it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
in accord with general surgical principles to arrest hemorrhage
at once.</p>

<p>Rupture usually takes place before the twelfth week,
and the whole product of conception, with the tube, may
readily be removed. Hemorrhage usually ceases as soon
as the proximal and distal ends of the ovarian artery are
ligated. The ligatures may be placed about the ovarian
artery, at the pelvic wall, and at the uterine cornu, as the
first steps of the operation, before any attempt is made to
remove the mass. It may be necessary to close the rent
in the broad ligament by a series of sutures.</p>

<p><i>After Rupture.</i>&mdash;If the woman survive, and is first
seen after primary rupture, one of two conditions will be
present&mdash;a destroyed or a developing extra-uterine pregnancy.
If the fetus has died and gestation has ceased,
the woman is exposed to the various dangers that attend
the presence of such a foreign body in the abdomen. If
the fetus has died during the earlier months, it may have
been absorbed and spontaneous cure may take place.
Even a dead full-term fetus has been carried in the abdomen
for years without producing a fatal result to the
mother. It seems safest, however, in all such cases to
operate as soon as the condition is recognized. The rules
of abdominal and pelvic surgery apply to such cases.
The placenta of a dead fetus may be removed without
fear of uncontrollable hemorrhage.</p>

<p>If the woman is seen after primary rupture, with a developing
gestation, the case presents much more serious
dangers. These dangers lie in the placenta. If the
pregnancy has not advanced beyond the fourth month, it
is usually possible to remove the whole of the gestation-sac,
the embryo, and the placenta without uncontrollable
hemorrhage. The ovarian, and if necessary the uterine,
arteries may be ligated, and the placenta may be removed
in one mass. The cavity of the broad ligament may be
obliterated by buried sutures.</p>

<p>If the gestation has advanced beyond the fourth month,
it is often impossible to remove the placenta without fatal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
hemorrhage. Many women have bled to death from the
attempt. The operator sometimes incises the placenta as
he enters the gestation-sac, and is obliged to proceed with
its removal. In other cases he starts to remove it, and
finds, too late, that the hemorrhage is beyond his control.
In the advanced months of pregnancy the sac and the
placenta may become adherent to any of the abdominal
or pelvic viscera and to the large vessels. Hemorrhage
cannot be controlled, as in the earlier months, by ligation
of the ovarian and uterine arteries. The result in
these cases is determined by the ability of the operator.
A full-term living child, the whole sac, and the placenta
have been successfully removed. If the attachments are
such that the surgeon considers it unsafe to attempt the
removal of the sac and the placenta, the sac should be
incised and the fetus should be removed, the cord being
divided between two ligatures; the sac should be sutured
to the abdominal incision; the cord should be drawn
through the opening, and the sac packed with gauze. At
the end of four or five days the gauze pack may be removed,
under anesthesia if necessary, and the placenta
may be taken away. There is very much less risk of
hemorrhage after the lapse of a few days. Some operators
prefer to allow the placenta to come away spontaneously.
This is sometimes necessary.</p>

<p>It will be seen, from this consideration, that the treatment
of all varieties of ectopic gestation is operative, and
that the sooner the operation is performed the better for
the patient. Consideration for the life of the child should
have no influence in determining the time of operation.</p>

<p><b id="OVARIAN_PREGNANCY">Ovarian Pregnancy.</b>&mdash;The possibility of the implantation
and development of the fertilized ovum in the
Graafian follicle has been denied by many authorities.
It seems probable, however, that such a form of pregnancy
does very rarely occur. The cause of ovarian pregnancy
is thought to be due to some disturbance of the normal
process of ovulation, whereby the ovum fails to leave the
ruptured follicle and is there fertilized and developed.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3 id="DISEASES_OF_THE_OVARIES">DISEASES OF THE OVARIES.</h3>

<p><b>Anatomy.</b>&mdash;The ovaries vary a good deal in size, within
the limits of health, in different individuals. It is
unusual to find the two ovaries in the same person exactly
alike in size, shape, and appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_158" src="images/fig_158.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 158.</span>&mdash;Uterus, tube, and ovary
of a child one month old (Sutton).</p></div>

<p>The size, shape, and appearance of the ovary change
at the different periods of life. In the new-born child
the ovary is elongated and
lies parallel to the Fallopian
tube (<a href="#fig_158">Fig. 158</a>). In rare
cases this infantile shape of
the ovary may persist
throughout life.</p>

<p>The general shape of the
mature ovary is oval. The
average measurements are&mdash;long
axis, 3 to 5 centimeters; breadth, 2 to 3 centimeters;
thickness, 12 millimeters; weight, 100 grains. These
measurements are subject to great variations. Henning’s
table of measurements shows that the ovary of the multipara
is no larger than that of the virgin.</p>

<p>After the menopause the ovaries shrink a great deal in
size, sharing in the general atrophy of all the reproductive
organs. The ovary of an old woman may weigh but
15 grains.</p>

<p>The healthy ovary is of a pinkish pearly color. On its
surface are seen small bluish areas that mark the position
of unruptured or of recently ruptured ovarian follicles.
The ripening follicles project somewhat from the surface
of the ovary, and the old ruptured follicles are marked by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
scars which in time cover and render irregular the whole
surface of the ovary (<a href="#fig_159">Fig. 159</a>).</p>

<p>The surface of the ovary becomes more irregular and
wrinkled after the menopause. The follicles disappear,
until finally nothing is left but a mass of fibrous tissue
and a few blood-vessels.</p>

<p>The ovary lies in the posterior layer of the broad ligament.
It is attached by this connection with the broad
ligament and by the ovarian and infundibulo-pelvic ligaments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_159" src="images/fig_159.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 159.</span>&mdash;Ovary (natural size), with the Fallopian tube in relative position
(Sutton).</p></div>

<p>The ovarian ligament extends from the inner end of
the ovary to the angle of the uterus immediately below
the origin of the Fallopian tube. This ligament varies
in length from 3 to 5 centimeters. It is shortest in the
virgin, and longest in the multiparous woman. The
ligament consists of a fold of peritoneum containing unstriped
muscular fiber from the uterus.</p>

<p>The infundibulo-pelvic ligament is that part of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
upper margin of the broad ligament lying between the
distal end of the Fallopian tube and the pelvic wall. It
is about 2 centimeters in length. The length is greatest
in the multiparous woman.</p>

<p>The position of the ovary is maintained by its attachments
and by its own specific gravity. The considerations
that have been discussed in regard to the position
of the uterus also apply here.</p>

<p>The blood-vessels are the utero-ovarian arteries and the
ovarian arteries and veins. The ovarian artery is homologous
to the spermatic artery in the male. The course
of the ovarian veins has an important influence upon
some pathological conditions of the ovaries.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_160" src="images/fig_160.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 160.</span>&mdash;View of the posterior surface of the uterus, Fallopian tubes,
ovaries, and broad ligaments. The infundibulo-pelvic ligament is shown on
the left (Dickinson).</p></div>

<p>The right ovarian vein enters the inferior vena cava at
an acute angle, and at the junction of the two there is a
very perfect valve.</p>

<p>The left ovarian vein enters the left renal vein at a
right angle: there is no valve on this side. This anatomical
difference affords a probable explanation of the
greater tendency to congestion and prolapse of the left
ovary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<p>The ovary is composed of connective tissue which surrounds
the Graafian follicles, blood-vessels, lymphatics,
nerves, and unstriped muscular fibers. The posterior
portion, or the free portion of the ovary, is covered with
the germinal epithelium, or modified peritoneum, which
is continuous with the peritoneum of the broad ligament.</p>

<p>The ovary is divided into two portions, which present
distinct anatomical, physiological, and pathological differences.</p>

<p>The <i>oöphoron</i> is the egg-bearing portion of the ovary.
It corresponds to the free border of the gland.</p>

<p>The <i>paroöphoron</i> corresponds to the hilum of the ovary&mdash;that
portion in relation with the broad ligament.</p>

<p>The paroöphoron contains no ovarian follicles. It is
composed of connective tissue and numerous blood-vessels.
In the paroöphoron of young ovaries remnants of
gland-tubules&mdash;vestiges of the Wolffian body&mdash;may be
found.</p>

<p><i>Accessory ovaries</i> have been described by several
writers, and their existence has often been assumed to
account for the persistence of menstruation after a supposed
complete salpingo-oöphorectomy. It is very doubtful
if a true accessory ovary has ever been found. Bland
Sutton says: “As the evidence at present stands, an accessory
ovary quite separate from the main gland, so as to
form a distinct organ, has yet to be described by a competent
observer.” It is probable that the bodies that
have been described as accessory ovaries have been more
or less detached portions of a lobulated ovary, or small
fibro-myomatous tumors of the ovarian ligament. Abdominal
surgeons have had opportunity of examining
thousands of ovaries at operation, and yet I know of no
one who has come across a third ovary.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3 id="DISEASES_OF_THE_OVARIES_CONTINUED">DISEASES OF THE OVARIES (Continued).</h3>

<h4 id="HERNIA_OF_THE_OVARY">HERNIA OF THE OVARY.</h4>

<p>Hernia of the ovary may take place through the inguinal
ring. Congenital hernia of the ovary is extremely
rare. Bland Sutton says that there is no properly
authenticated case. Notwithstanding the frequency of
congenital hernia in infants, the ovary has not been
found in the hernial sac at birth.</p>

<p>In cases that have been reported as congenital hernia
of the ovaries the structures have, on microscopical examination,
been found to be testicles, the individual
being hermaphroditic.</p>

<p>Acquired hernia of the ovary is of not infrequent occurrence.
The ovary may occupy the hernial sac alone
or along with other structures.</p>

<p>Ovulation may occur normally, and conception may
take place. A true corpus luteum has been found in an
ovary contained in a hernial sac.</p>

<p>The ovary may remain in the inguinal ring or may
pass into the labium majus. In some cases no trouble
whatever arises from this displacement. Hernia of the
ovary has been found accidentally at autopsy, having
been entirely overlooked during life. In other cases
swelling and severe pain may be experienced at the menstrual
periods.</p>

<p>The ovary is exposed to the dangers of congestion and
inflammation. Adhesions may result, and suppuration
has occurred. In such cases the symptoms of ovaritis
are present.</p>

<p>The <b>diagnosis</b> of hernia of the ovary is made from
palpation of the gland; from the determination, by bimanual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
examination, of its connection with the uterus;
from the characteristic sickening pain experienced upon
pressure; and from the swelling and increased pain at
the menstrual period.</p>

<p>The <b>treatment</b> is the same as that applied to hernia
of any other structure. The hernia should be reduced
if possible, and retained by a truss; or the ring may be
closed by radical operation for hernia. If the ovary is
adherent, operation is necessary before reduction can be
accomplished. If the ovary is itself grossly diseased, its
removal may be necessary.</p>

<h4 id="PROLAPSE_OF_THE_OVARY">PROLAPSE OF THE OVARY.</h4>

<p>Prolapse of the ovary is a downward displacement of
this organ behind the uterus. Various degrees of prolapse
occur, from a slight descent to complete prolapse
in the bottom of Douglas’s pouch.</p>

<p>There are two general kinds of ovarian prolapse. In
one the uterus is primarily the displaced organ, and when
prolapsed, retroverted, or retroflexed, it drags the ovaries
out of place with it. Such cases have been referred to
in discussing uterine displacement. If the ovaries are
not adherent, they usually return to the normal position
when the uterus is replaced. Similar to this kind of displacement
of the ovary is that which occurs in disease
of the Fallopian tubes, which, when enlarged, descend
and drag the ovaries with them. In the other variety
the displacement is primary in the ovary, and occurs independently
of any displacement of the uterus or other
structure to which it is attached. It is such prolapse
that will be considered here.</p>

<p>There are various <b>causes</b> of ovarian prolapse. In
some cases it is probable that the position of the ovaries
in the bottom of Douglas’s pouch is congenital.</p>

<p>A sudden strain or effort is said to have produced acute
prolapse of the ovary.</p>

<p>Anything that increases the weight of the ovary may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
cause its descent. Prolonged congestion, inflammation,
or small ovarian tumors may result in ovarian prolapse.</p>

<p>Subinvolution is the most frequent cause of ovarian
prolapse. In pregnancy the ovaries become very much
enlarged, especially the left one. The ovarian ligament
and the infundibulo-pelvic ligament become much increased
in length. If, after labor, involution is arrested
or is incomplete for any reason, the conditions favorable
for prolapse of the ovary will be present&mdash;increased
weight of the ovary and relaxation and lengthening of
its attachments. Sometimes the cause of the prolapse is
in the ligaments alone. The ovary may have returned to
its normal size, while the ligaments may have remained
subinvoluted, permitting undue freedom of movement.</p>

<p>The left ovary is more frequently prolapsed than the
right. There are two reasons for this difference. As has
just been said, the left ovary becomes more enlarged during
pregnancy, and therefore suffers more from subinvolution,
and the arrangement of the veins on the left
side is such that venous congestion is very liable to
occur.</p>

<p>When prolapse has existed for a long time, secondary
changes take place in the ovary as the result of hyperemia,
and the condition becomes further aggravated.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;Slight descent of the ovary very often
causes no suffering whatever. When, however, the
ovary is completely prolapsed, lying in the bottom of
Douglas’s pouch, between the posterior wall of the
vagina and the rectum, well-marked symptoms usually
arise.</p>

<p>The woman suffers pain whenever she is in the erect
position. The pain is increased by walking, probably
because the ovary is squeezed between the cervix and the
sacrum. Coitus sometimes causes intense pain. Defecation
causes pain. The pain begins with the movements
of the bowels, and often lasts for one or two hours afterward.
It is dull and aching in character, and is situated
in the normal position of the ovary, radiating thence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
throughout the pelvis and extending down the thighs.
It frequently produces faintness and nausea.</p>

<p>The ovarian pain is markedly increased at the menstrual
periods.</p>

<p>The general and reflex disturbances produced by prolapse
of the ovary are often very pronounced. There
may be headache, indigestion, hysteria, and great mental
depression. A reflex pain is often felt in the breast on
the same side with the affected ovary.</p>

<p>Bimanual examination usually reveals the condition.
The prolapsed ovary may readily be felt by the vaginal
finger. If the finger is introduced high up behind the
cervix, and is then turned with the palmar surface backward,
the ovary may be caught between the finger and
the sacrum. The irregular surface of the ovary, due to
the prominent vesicles and the old scars, may often be
felt. When the ovary is pressed upon there is a characteristic
sickening feeling experienced by the woman.
Sometimes she cries out with intense pain even upon the
gentlest pressure on the ovary. After witnessing such
pain the physician realizes the extent of the suffering experienced
in walking, at coitus, and at defecation. If
the ovary is not adherent, it may slip from the examining
finger, and perhaps may not be felt again until a
subsequent examination, after it has returned to its prolapsed
position.</p>

<p>A large prolapsed ovary has often been mistaken for
the fundus uteri, and has caused the diagnosis of retroflexion
to be made. This mistake will not occur if the
examiner determines the real position of the uterus by
palpation or by the sound. The uterus may usually be
moved independently of the prolapsed ovary.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;The treatment of ovarian prolapse depends
upon the cause of the condition. Prolapse of the
ovary caused by uterine displacement is usually cured by
the treatment that restores the uterus to its normal position.</p>

<p>Prolapse of the ovary accompanying tubal disease and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
prolapse caused by small ovarian tumors demand operation
and removal of the tube and ovary.</p>

<p>When the ovary is not adherent, it may sometimes be
restored to its normal position, or at least be considerably
elevated, so that the suffering is much relieved, by placing
the woman in the knee-chest position and opening
the vagina. In this position all the pelvic structures are
carried upward.</p>

<p>A pledget of cotton or wool placed back of the cervix,
in the posterior vaginal fornix, will often give great
temporary relief. The cotton may stay in the vagina for
twenty-four to forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>The woman should be advised to assume the knee-chest
position, allowing air to enter the vagina by introducing
the nozzle-piece of the vaginal syringe, once or
twice daily. The best time is immediately before retiring
at night, and she should afterwards sleep as much as
possible on the side, in the Sims position. She should
remain in the knee-chest position for several minutes&mdash;until
tired.</p>

<p>In addition to this treatment, the pelvic congestion
should be relieved by continuous use of saline laxatives,
by hot-water vaginal douches, and by occasional applications
of Churchill’s tincture of iodine to the vaginal
vault, and the use of the glycerine tampon. If the prolapse
has been caused by subinvolution of the ovary and
its attachments, such treatment may ultimately result in
cure. The enlarged ovary diminishes in size and weight,
and its ligaments contract and regain tonicity.</p>

<p>Subinvolution of the uterus is often also present. This
condition should be treated as has already been advised.</p>

<p>In many cases of ovarian prolapse there have taken
place in the ovary secondary changes that resist such
treatment even when most conscientiously applied. The
physician is then driven to the operation of oöphorectomy
as the only method of relieving the intolerable suffering.
This operation should never be performed, however, until
other milder treatment has been carefully tried, and unless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
the suffering of the woman incapacitates her for the
duties of life.</p>

<p>In some cases in which the ovary is not itself grossly
diseased it may be possible to avoid oöphorectomy, and
to correct the displacement by attaching the ovary by
suture to the upper margin of the broad ligament, or by
shortening the infundibulo-pelvic ligament by suture.
If the ovary has become adherent in Douglas’s pouch,
the condition can be relieved only by operation&mdash;celiotomy,
and usually oöphorectomy.</p>

<p>A variety of pessaries have been invented for the relief
of ovarian prolapse. They are of but little, if any, use.
In many cases the pressure of the pessary upon the ovary
renders its employment impossible. No pessary will
cure a simple prolapse of the ovary. The cases in which
the pessary does good are those in which there is a primary
uterine displacement.</p>

<h4 id="INFLAMMATION_OF_THE_OVARY_OOPHORITIS_OR_OVARITIS">INFLAMMATION OF THE OVARY; OÖPHORITIS OR OVARITIS.</h4>

<p><b id="ACUTE_OOPHORITIS">Acute Oöphoritis.</b>&mdash;In acute oöphoritis the inflammation
may begin on the surface of the ovary (<i>perioöphoritis</i>)
and extend inward, or it may begin in the
ovary itself. When the disease is caused by extension
of the inflammation from the tubes, it usually begins as
a perioöphoritis. Both the follicular and interstitial portions
of the ovary may be affected. When the inflammation
is confined chiefly to the ovarian follicles, it is
said to be <i>parenchymatous</i>; when the connective tissue is
chiefly affected, it is called <i>interstitial oöphoritis</i>. In
acute inflammations all portions of the ovary are usually
involved at one time.</p>

<p>The changes are those that characterize inflammation
of other glandular structures. The whole organ becomes
swollen, hyperemic, and edematous. The liquor folliculi
becomes turbid; the membrana granulosa becomes softened
and disintegrated. The surface of the ovary may
be covered with an inflammatory exudate. In severe
septic cases the whole ovary may become destroyed, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
one or more ovarian abscesses may be formed. In less
severe cases the inflammation subsides before suppuration
takes place, or goes on to chronic oöphoritis.</p>

<p>The usual <i>cause</i> of acute oöphoritis is extension of inflammation
from the Fallopian tube.</p>

<p>Acute oöphoritis may also occur as the result of septic
infection carried by the lymphatics of the uterus. The
disease is not uncommon in puerperal sepsis. Here it
often forms but a minor part of a general fatal infection.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea may cause oöphoritis in a similar way.</p>

<p>Acute suppression of menstruation is said to result in
inflammation of the ovaries.</p>

<p>Acute rheumatism and the eruptive fevers may produce
oöphoritis. The disease of the ovaries is often overlooked
during the acute attack, while the attention of the physician
is engaged by the general affection. These diseases,
occurring in childhood, are the probable causes of some
of the damaged and chronically inflamed ovaries with
which women suffer in later life. To these diseases also
are to be attributed many cases of arrested development
of the sexual apparatus, the phenomena of which appear
only after menstruation has begun. The ovarian disease
in these cases may be very insidious. Decided
microscopic changes have been found in the ovarian
follicles in scarlet fever, though to the naked eye the
gland was unchanged.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i> of acute oöphoritis are very often masked
by those of accompanying affections, such as salpingitis
and puerperal sepsis.</p>

<p>There may be a chill, followed by fever, nausea, and
vomiting.</p>

<p>The pain is that which characterizes any local pelvic
inflammation. It is most intense in the ovarian regions.</p>

<p>Bimanual examination may reveal the enlarged, tender
ovaries, which are very often prolapsed behind the uterus.</p>

<p>The greatest gentleness should always be observed in
making a vaginal examination in any case of inflammation
of the pelvic structures, not only to avoid inflicting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
unnecessary pain, but because a much more satisfactory
examination can be made if the woman does not fear and
resist the examiner.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The treatment of acute oöphoritis is expectant.
It is similar to that already advised for acute
salpingitis. The physician should prescribe absolute rest
in bed; hot fomentations over the abdomen; saline laxatives;
and warm vaginal douches of sterile water if the
pain is not increased by them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_161" src="images/fig_161.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 161.</span>&mdash;Cystic ovary.</p></div>

<p>If suppuration occurs, immediate laparotomy with removal
of the diseased structures should be practised. If
the acute inflammation subside, subsequent operation
may be necessary for the chronic inflammation.</p>

<p><b id="CHRONIC_OOPHORITIS">Chronic Oöphoritis.</b>&mdash;Chronic oöphoritis, like the
acute form, may be either parenchymatous or interstitial.
Usually both the connective tissue and the ovarian follicles
are involved. The disease is usually bilateral. The
tunica albuginea may become much thickened, and adhesions
may form between the ovary and the adjacent structures.</p>

<p>In practice we find chronic oöphoritis in two forms:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
The ovary may be cystic, filled with a number of cysts
of varying size up to that of a marble (<a href="#fig_161">Fig. 161</a>). These
cysts are transformed ovarian follicles. The walls are
thickened, and the ova and the membrana granulosa
have undergone fatty degeneration and absorption. The
fluid in the cysts may be clear, cloudy, bloody, or gelatinous.
Sometimes the septa are absorbed, and several
cysts are thrown into one cavity. The connective tissue
of the ovary is increased in amount.</p>

<p>The ovary becomes enlarged, though it rarely exceeds
the size of a hen’s egg.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_162" src="images/fig_162.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 162.</span>&mdash;Cirrhotic ovary from an old maid forty years of age.</p></div>

<p>It is probable that this form of inflammatory change is
the origin of some kinds of small ovarian cystic tumors.</p>

<p>In the other form of chronic oöphoritis the interstitial
changes are most marked. There is a decided increase
of the connective tissue, and a diminution of the parenchymatous
or follicular structures. The ovary is hard
and cirrhotic, and is of a lighter or paler color than
normal; the visible ovarian follicles are few; the greater
part of the ovary appears to be a mass of wrinkled connective
tissue; in some cases the follicular structure is
confined to but one-quarter of the ovary. The changes
resemble and are similar to those that take place physiologically
in the ovaries of old women (see <a href="#fig_162">Fig. 162</a>).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
Between these two types of cystic and cirrhotic ovaries
various forms, combinations of the two, may occur. The
ovary upon one side may be cystic, upon the other cirrhotic.</p>

<p>The <i>causes</i> of chronic oöphoritis are various. The
condition may persist after the subsidence of acute
oöphoritis. It is usually secondary to salpingitis. There
are very few cases of chronic salpingitis that are not accompanied
by some form of oöphoritis. The disease
may be chronic from the beginning. It may develop
slowly from septic or gonorrheal infection from the
uterus. It may result from subinvolution or prolapse of
the ovary.</p>

<p>It may result from immoderate sexual irritation, and
from unnatural gratification of the sexual impulse.</p>

<p>It seems probable also that chronic ovaritis may occur
as the result of celibacy or sterility. The unceasing
menstrual congestions of the virgin or the sterile woman,
which, as has already been pointed out, seem to predispose
the woman to fibroid changes in the uterus, seem
likewise to develop the growth of connective tissue in
the ovary. Virgins between the ages of thirty and forty
often present hard cirrhotic ovaries with decided diminution
of the follicular elements. The condition is often
associated with a fibroid state of the uterus, this organ
being indurated from interstitial fibroid deposit, or presenting
one or more subperitoneal nodules.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;The most prominent symptom of chronic
oöphoritis is pain. The disease is usually bilateral, and
the pain affects both ovarian regions; it is, however,
usually more marked upon the left side. The pain is increased
by the erect position and by exercise, defecation,
and coitus. Pain at defecation and coitus is most marked
when ovarian prolapse accompanies the inflammation.</p>

<p>The pain is increased at the menstrual period. It is
most intense immediately before and at the beginning of
the flow. If the bleeding is profuse, the pain is often
relieved.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>Menorrhagia often accompanies chronic oöphoritis, and
seems to occur chiefly with the cystic variety of the disease.
As most cases of oöphoritis are accompanied by
endometritis and salpingitis, it is difficult to determine
how important a part in the production of the menorrhagia
is played by the ovarian disease. Reflex pain in
the region of one or both breasts, usually the left, is often
complained of.</p>

<p>The reflex disturbances caused by chronic oöphoritis
form a very important part of the woman’s suffering.
Loss of appetite, digestive disturbances, nausea, and
vomiting occur. Hysteria, profound mental depression,
and various cerebral derangements take place. Sterility
may be caused by chronic oöphoritis if the ovarian capsule
becomes so thickened that rupture of ovarian follicles
cannot take place.</p>

<p>Bimanual examination should be performed with great
gentleness. The condition of the ovary may be most
satisfactorily determined in those cases in which the
ovarian lesion is the chief trouble and in which the tubes
and other pelvic structures are not coincidently inflamed.
If the ovary is felt, it is found to be very tender and usually
enlarged. In cases of long-standing interstitial inflammation
the ovary may be below the usual size. Palpation
is very easy if the ovary is prolapsed in Douglas’s
pouch.</p>

<p>Chronic oöphoritis rarely recovers spontaneously. The
woman may have periods of relief, but the symptoms may
all recur after some indiscretion or unusual exercise.
Suffering usually diminishes, and may in time cease, after
the menopause, when atrophy takes place and menstrual
congestions have stopped.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Chronic oöphoritis usually requires operative
treatment (salpingo-oöphorectomy), because it is
associated with disease of the tubes. In other cases a
great deal may be accomplished without operation, and
the woman may be tided over the period of menstrual
life until permanent relief is secured at the menopause.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span></p>

<p>This palliative treatment is usually applicable, however,
only to those women who are not dependent for a
living upon their own labor. It is best to begin the treatment
by putting the woman to bed for one or two months;
to administer daily massage; to maintain mild purgation
with saline purgatives; to make, once a week, applications
of Churchill’s tincture of iodine to the vaginal
vault, followed by the glycerin tampon; and to give hot-water
vaginal injections twice a day.</p>

<p>If there is any disease of the uterus, such as laceration
of the cervix or endometritis, this should be treated first.</p>

<p>After the woman leaves her bed the douches, saline
laxatives, and vaginal applications should be continued.
Absolute rest in the recumbent posture should be prescribed
at the menstrual periods, and at other times if
the ovarian pain becomes severe. Coitus should be forbidden
during the treatment. If the woman is unable
to begin the treatment by prolonged rest, the subsequent
part of the treatment advised here may be followed.</p>

<p>This treatment always does good for a time. Unfortunately,
its results are not often permanent. The old pain
and suffering return as soon as the woman ceases to be
under medical care. If the inflammatory changes have
become well established, no permanent good results from
any medical treatment. This is especially true in those
cases in which the original causative state of things continues
after treatment is given up. If the cirrhotic
ovaries are the result of celibacy, medicine can be but
palliative.</p>

<p>Working-women are unable to obtain the proper medical
treatment, especially when the prospect of cure is
doubtful, and therefore, if their suffering incapacitates
them, must be subjected to the operation of oöphorectomy.</p>

<p>In any case oöphorectomy should be advised if the suffering
persists after carefully tried medical treatment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>

<h4 id="APOPLEXY_OF_THE_OVARY">APOPLEXY OF THE OVARY.</h4>

<p>Hemorrhage may take place either into an ovarian
follicle, in which case it is called follicular hemorrhage;
or it may take place into the ovarian stroma; to this
condition the term ovarian apoplexy is applied.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage into the follicles is usually small in
amount, the distended follicle rarely exceeding the size
of a hickory-nut. In case of cystic degeneration of the
ovary small blood-filled cysts may be present, formed by
the fusion of several follicular cysts. Occasionally the
amount of blood in the follicle is enough to cause its rupture.
If the follicle should rupture into the peritoneum,
a small hematocele would result. If the follicle ruptures
into the ovarian stroma, ovarian apoplexy occurs.</p>

<p>Follicular hemorrhage and ovarian apoplexy are most
liable to occur during the congestion of a menstrual
period.</p>

<p>Such hemorrhages are not infrequent in the acute
fevers and in scurvy. The symptoms of the condition
are in no way characteristic. If the exact state of the
ovary were known from previous examination, follicular
hemorrhage or apoplexy might be suspected from the detection
of a sudden ovarian enlargement and pain unaccompanied
by symptoms of inflammation.</p>

<p>The blood is usually absorbed, and unless some accompanying
disease of the ovary is present, spontaneous recovery
will result.</p>

<h4 id="OVARIAN_HYDROCELE">OVARIAN HYDROCELE.</h4>

<p>Ovarian hydrocele is a rare disease, the true nature of
which has been explained by Bland Sutton. Most of
the cases that have been reported have been mistaken
for tubo-ovarian cysts. The tubo-ovarian cyst has
already been described. It is a cyst that results from inflammatory
disease of the tube, and is formed by the
union of the cavities of a closed Fallopian tube and a
follicular cyst in the ovary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span></p>

<p>Ovarian hydrocele has a different origin. To understand
it a brief reference to the relation between the ovary and
the broad ligament is necessary. I quote from Bland
Sutton: “The ovary projects from, and is invested by
the posterior layer of the broad ligament. When the
parts are examined <i>in situ</i>, the ovary will be found to lie
in or upon the edge of a shallow recess in the mesosalpinx.
This recess is the ovarian sac (<a href="#fig_163">Fig. 163</a>). It
varies in depth; in many it is small and inconspicuous,
whilst in others it is sufficiently deep to accommodate
the entire ovary. In the virgin the ampulla of the tube
falls over the mouth of this recess and conceals the ovary.
This relation of parts is usually disturbed in the first
pregnancy.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_163" src="images/fig_163.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 163.</span>&mdash;Left Fallopian tube from an adult (after Richard).</p></div>

<p>Tait<a  id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> says: “In a few exceptions I have seen a crescentic
double fold of the posterior layer of the broad
ligament pass down behind the ovary, covering it like
the hood of a ‘Nepenthes’ gland. In all such cases the
women have been sterile, probably because this hood has
prevented the application to the ovary of the opening of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
the oviduct. I have seen this arrangement give great
trouble in the removal of small ovaries.” In some
animals the ovarian sac is much better developed than in
the human female. In the hyena it forms a complete
tunic to the ovary, the cavity of the sac communicating
with the peritoneum by a small opening. In rats and
mice the sac is complete, and the Fallopian tube communicates
with the ovarian sac, but not with the general
peritoneal cavity.</p>

<p>Ovarian hydrocele occurs in women when the abdominal
ostium of the Fallopian tube opens into a well-formed
ovarian sac and the common cavity becomes distended
with fluid.</p>

<p>Sutton sums up the peculiarities of ovarian hydrocele
as follows:</p>

<p>I. The Fallopian tube opens by its abdominal ostium
into a sac on the posterior aspect of the broad ligament.</p>

<p>II. The tube is elongated, dilated, and tortuous, resembling
a retort with a convoluted delivery tube.</p>

<p>III. As a rule, there is no evidence of inflammation.
The cyst may suppurate should the tube become affected
with salpingitis.</p>

<p>IV. In small cysts the ovary will be found projecting
on the floor of the sac. In larger specimens it will be
incorporated with the wall of the sac, and in very large
specimens it is unrecognizable.</p>

<p>An ovarian hydrocele may attain considerable size. A
case has been reported in which three pints of straw-colored
fluid were found in the cyst. An ovarian hydrocele
is sometimes intermitting, discharging its contents
through the tube into the uterus.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i> of ovarian hydrocele resemble those of
a small ovarian cyst or a tubo-ovarian cyst.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> is celiotomy and removal of the tube
and ovary, or, when practicable, the liberation of the
adherent end of the Fallopian tube.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3 id="CYSTIC_TUMORS_OF_THE_OVARY">CYSTIC TUMORS OF THE OVARY.</h3>

<p>The histogenesis of cystic tumors of the ovary is not
yet definitely settled. Every structure that enters into
the composition of the ovary has been supposed to form
the starting-point of these tumors. There are many classifications
of ovarian cysts based upon the clinical, structural,
or genetic features. The classification given here
seems to me to be the best we have at present for the
practical physician.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_164" src="images/fig_164.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 164.</span>&mdash;Diagram representing the cyst-regions of the ovary and broad
ligament.</p></div>

<p>Cystic tumors of the ovary may be divided into two
general classes:</p>

<p>I. Oöphoritic cysts, which originate from the oöphoron,
or the egg-bearing portion of the ovary.</p>

<p>II. Paroöphoritic cysts, which originate in the paroöphoron.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<h4 id="OOPHORITIC_CYSTS">OÖPHORITIC CYSTS.</h4>

<p>Cysts of the oöphoron may be subdivided into (<i>a</i>) Follicular
cysts; (<i>b</i>) Glandular cysts; (<i>c</i>) Dermoid cysts.</p>

<p><b id="FOLLICULAR_CYSTS">Follicular Cysts.</b>&mdash;Follicular cysts originate in the
ovarian follicles. If anything occurs to prevent the
physiological rupture of a mature ovarian follicle, a follicular
cyst may be started. Such cysts begin as retention-cysts
of the ovarian follicles.</p>

<p>The condition is usually the result of chronic inflammation.
The formation of new connective tissue in the
ovarian stroma, the thickening of the tunica albuginea,
the presence of inflammatory exudate upon the surface
of the ovary, may all prevent the rupture of the follicles.
In addition, the inflammatory congestion of the walls of
the follicle produces an increased exudation into the
ovisac.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_165" src="images/fig_165.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 165.</span>&mdash;Follicular cyst of the ovary.</p></div>

<p>It seems probable that such inflammatory action may
also produce cystic distention in the immature follicles
that are situated remote from the surface of the ovary.</p>

<p>Follicular cysts may occur at any age, though they are
most common during the period of sexual activity. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
follicular cysts may occur in one or in both ovaries; usually
both ovaries are affected.</p>

<p>Only one follicle may be involved, or a large number
of follicles, in different degrees of cystic distention, may
be found scattered throughout the ovary.</p>

<p>Frequently one follicle enlarged to the size of a hen’s
egg is observed projecting from the surface of the ovary.
Sometimes the intervening septa atrophy, and one large
cavity is formed by the union of two or more cystic
follicles.</p>

<p>Follicular cysts of the ovary do not increase indefinitely
with age. They are limited in growth, and in this respect
differ essentially from the glandular oöphoritic
cysts. They are usually about the size of a hen’s egg.
They rarely attain a size greater than that of the adult
fist. Exceptional cases have been reported in which the
ovarian tumor was the size of the adult head. The tumor
may be composed of one chief cyst-cavity, while the rest
of the ovary may present a much less marked degree of
cystic distention; or a large number of follicles may be
uniformly distended each to the size of a cherry, forming
an ovarian tumor as large as a child’s head.</p>

<p>When the ovarian follicle becomes distended the walls
usually increase in thickness and strength.</p>

<p>The interior of the cyst is smooth. The character of
the lining membrane varies with the size of the cavity.
In small cysts it is the membrana granulosa&mdash;columnar
epithelium. In cysts of medium size the cavity is lined
with stratified epithelium. In the largest cavities there
may be no epithelium present, the lining membrane being
fibrous tissue.</p>

<p>The follicular cyst is usually filled with clear serum
having a specific gravity of 1005 to 1020. It resembles
normal liquor folliculi. The fluid may be purulent as a
result of septic infection, or it may be brown or black
from the presence of altered blood. Ova are sometimes
found in follicular cysts of moderate size. Sometimes
hemorrhage takes place into the follicular cyst, forming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
a follicular blood-cyst, which may attain the size
of a man’s fist.</p>

<p><i>Cyst of the Corpus Luteum.</i>&mdash;A variety of the follicular
cyst is the cyst of the corpus luteum. Such a cyst is
formed by the degeneration and cystic distention of a
corpus luteum. These cysts are usually of small size,
rarely exceeding that of a walnut. The walls are thick
and of a characteristic light-yellow color. The cavity is
lined by a delicate membrane. Cysts of the corpus
luteum are rare in the human female, but are very
common in some of the lower animals&mdash;the cow and the
mare.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_166" src="images/fig_166.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 166.</span>&mdash;Cyst of the corpus luteum, showing the yellow lining membrane (<i>a</i>);
<i>b</i>, small follicular cyst.</p></div>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i> caused by follicular cysts are those
of pressure and ovarian pain. The cyst may become
impacted and adherent in the pelvis, and may cause
pressure. The ovarian pain is analogous to that described
under Chronic Oöphoritis. The pain that accompanies
this form of cystic tumor of the ovary is much
more marked than in the case of the larger kinds of ovarian
cyst, which may be unattended by any ovarian pain
whatever. In some cases follicular cystic disease of the
ovaries is accompanied by menorrhagia or metrorrhagia
which is only relieved by oöphorectomy. This symptom,
however, is not usual.</p>

<p>The <i>diagnosis</i> of the condition is made by bimanual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
examination and by observation of the clinical course of
the disease. The cystic disease is very often bilateral.
The ovarian enlargement is slow in development and is
always limited. A moderate maximum size is reached
and may persist for years.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The only curative treatment of follicular
cystic disease of the ovaries is by operation and removal
of the tumor. Operation is required only in those cases
in which the suffering is great. The mere presence of
the cystic ovary does not demand operation, whether it
causes physical suffering or not, as in the case of the
cystic tumors hereafter to be considered. It must be remembered,
however, that it is often difficult or impossible
to make a differential diagnosis between follicular cyst of
the ovary and a young glandular or papillomatous cyst,
and it is very much safer in all doubtful cases to adopt
the operative rather than the expectant plan of treatment.
If, after the abdomen is opened, the cyst is found to be
follicular, the ovary need not necessarily be removed.</p>

<p>If, at the time of operation, the ovary is found to present
but one follicular cystic cavity, this may be opened
and evacuated and part of the wall may be excised. If
bleeding occurs from the edges of the cyst-wall, it may be
controlled by whipping with a fine continuous suture of
silk or catgut. Some operators avoid this bleeding by
opening the cyst with the cautery-knife. In any case
the bleeding is usually slight if a thin portion of the cyst-wall
is selected for the incision. If the ovary is filled
with a number of cystic cavities, it is safest to remove the
whole organ. If the woman be young and anxious for
children, the portion of the ovary that contains the cysts
may be excised and the wound in the ovary closed by
sutures of fine catgut. Simple puncture of the cysts does
no good. The conservative operation is especially desirable
in case both ovaries are diseased. When but one is
affected, the surgeon need not hesitate so much before
performing oöphorectomy.</p>

<p>If, as is very often the case in cystic disease of this
character, the Fallopian tubes are found closed by inflammatory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
adhesions, salpingo-oöphorectomy is usually indicated.</p>

<p><b id="GLANDULAR_CYSTS">Glandular Cysts.</b>&mdash;Glandular cysts are also called
<i>multilocular ovarian cysts</i> or <i>ovarian adenomata</i>.</p>

<p>It was formerly thought that all ovarian cysts originated
in the Graafian follicles. This view has now been given
up by most pathologists. The follicular cysts that have
just been described never attain a large size, and run a
distinctly different course from the glandular cysts now
under consideration.</p>

<p>The glandular cysts probably originate from the tubes
of Pflüger. It will be remembered that in the embryo
the ovary contains many epithelial tubules derived from
the germinal epithelium that covers the surface of the
ovary. These are the tubes of Pflüger. In the process
of development they become converted into Graafian
follicles. Abnormally they persist, and have been
found in the ovary at an advanced age, as late as the
seventy-fifth year. In the newborn infant these tubes
have been found cystic&mdash;the size of a pea. Such cystic
degeneration of persistent tubes of Pflüger is the probable
origin of glandular cysts of the ovary. According to this
view, all such cysts are due to a congenital defect. Some
are perhaps formed congenitally, and remain stationary
or develop in later life.</p>

<p>The central cells of the tubes of Pflüger soften and become
liquefied, and the tube becomes distended into a
small pouch lined with primitive glandular epithelium.</p>

<p>The outer surface of a typical glandular cyst of the
ovary presents a smooth, glistening, silvery appearance.
This appearance is subject to considerable variation according
to the character of the cyst-contents, the thickness
of the wall, and the inflammatory and necrotic
changes that have taken place. Sometimes there are
ocher-colored or brownish spots upon the surface.</p>

<p>The surface of the cyst is often lobulated, from the
presence of smaller cysts or a collection of secondary
cysts in the wall.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span></p>

<p>The <i>wall</i> of the cyst is composed of fibrous tissue containing
elastic and unstriped muscular fibers. Traces of
normal ovarian tissue may be discovered in the cyst-wall.
Sometimes a corpus luteum is found in the wall of a cyst
of large size, showing that ovarian follicles may ripen
and rupture, and that conception may take place even
though the ovary is grossly diseased.</p>

<p>The thickest portion of the cyst-wall is that in the
region of the pedicle. The thinnest portion is usually
opposite the peduncular attachment.</p>

<p>By careful dissection the wall may generally be divided
into three layers&mdash;an external and an internal layer of
fibrous structure, and a middle layer of loose connective
tissue. This differentiation is best marked in the region
of the pedicle. In the thinnest part of the cyst the coats
become blended into a thin, homogeneous, fibrous structure.</p>

<p>The outer surface of the cyst is covered with a layer of
endothelial cells. This is not a peritoneal investment.
It is intimately connected with the outer fibrous coat of
the cyst, and cannot be stripped off. In this respect these
cysts differ from some hereafter to be described, in which
there is a distinct detachable peritoneal covering.</p>

<p>The blood-vessels of the tumor are distinguished
throughout the fibrous wall. When three lamellæ are
present, the large arteries are found in the middle layer.
Lymphatics, often of large size, are also found in the
cyst-wall.</p>

<p>The glandular cyst is always, at first, multilocular; the
tumor is made up of several cyst-cavities. As the tumor
increases in size the pressure causes atrophy of intervening
septa, so that two or more cavities are thrown into
one, and the number of loculi becomes correspondingly
diminished. As the cyst grows, therefore, the tendency
is toward the unilocular form. Careful examination of
a unilocular glandular cyst will usually reveal the remains
of atrophied septa upon the walls.</p>

<p>The epithelial <i>lining</i> of these cysts is usually composed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
of columnar cells. In cavities of large size the cells are
flattened by pressure, and in cavities of the largest size
fatty degeneration and atrophy may have taken place, so
that the lining cells entirely disappear.</p>

<p>The cavities are often lined with a soft, velvety membrane,
microscopically similar to mucous membrane.
The columnar epithelium dips below the surface to form
complex mucous glands. These glands may become obstructed,
and secondary mucous retention-cysts are formed
in the walls of the parent cyst. Such a mass of secondary
cysts is often seen projecting into the main cyst-cavity
or forming a lobulated prominence upon its outer
surface.</p>

<p>Follicular cystic degeneration, such as has already been
described, may occur in the ovarian tissue of the wall of
the glandular cyst, so that a secondary group of small
cystic cavities may be formed.</p>

<p>It is thus seen that the structure of an oöphoritic
glandular cyst may be very complex. There may be one
or more chief cyst-cavities, on the walls of which may be
discovered the remains of septa which had formerly subdivided
them. Projecting into the cavities may be seen
honeycomb-like masses of secondary mucous retention-cysts;
while in the walls of the tumor, perhaps rendering
the surface lobulated, may be seen minor cyst-cavities
formed by beginning glandular cystic degeneration or by
simple cystic degeneration of ovarian follicles (<a href="#fig_167">Fig. 167</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>contents</i> of a glandular cyst vary greatly, not only
in different cysts, but in the different cavities of the
same cyst. Pseudomucin, a peculiar <i>mucoid</i> substance
excreted from the lining gland cells, is a most important
constituent of the contents of this cyst, and is almost
characteristic.</p>

<p>The fluid may be thin and colorless; it may resemble
thick, tenacious mucus; it may be oily or syrupy in consistency;
or it may resemble transparent jelly. It may be
colorless, yellow, apple-green, or brown or black from the
presence of decomposed blood. As a rule, the fluid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
becomes thinner as the cyst increases in size and age.
The change is probably due to the alteration that takes
place in the character of the lining membrane under the
influence of continuously increasing pressure.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of the fluid varies from 1010 to
1050.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 167.</span>&mdash;An oöphoritic glandular cyst. The section shows the remains of
an atrophied septum, a number of follicular cysts in the wall, and to the right

<p>As glandular cysts of the ovary originate in the free
border of the gland, they are in the great majority of
cases intra-peritoneal in their growth. They grow into
the peritoneal or the abdominal cavity; they do not push
aside layers of peritoneum, like the cysts that originate
between the folds of the broad ligament, and which are
extra-peritoneal in their development.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span></p>

<p>Very rarely glandular cysts of the ovary have been
found that grew between the layers of the broad ligament
and were extra-peritoneal in development. It may be
that in such cases the ovary itself had occupied an abnormal
position.</p>

<p>The shape of the ovary is very early destroyed by a
glandular cyst. The ovarian tissue is incorporated with,
and is spread throughout the cyst-wall. In small tumors
the remains of the hilum may be found at the pedicle.
In no case is the body of the ovary discoverable as a
distinct structure lying upon the surface of the cyst.</p>

<p>The <i>pedicle</i> of the cyst is composed of the ovarian ligament,
the upper portion of the broad ligament, and the
Fallopian tube. These structures are all more or less
thickened and lengthened as a result of the traction and
of the altered nutrition produced by the growing cyst.</p>

<p>The vessels of the pedicle that are derived from the
ovarian and uterine arteries are of various size. The
arteries rarely exceed the size of the radial artery.</p>

<p>Glandular cysts are of unlimited growth. They increase
in size until they destroy the woman by direct
pressure. They literally crowd her out of existence.</p>

<p>The size they may attain is determined only by the
powers of resistance of the woman and the distensibility
of the abdominal walls. Glandular cysts have been removed
that weighed 200 pounds.</p>

<p>The shape of the glandular cyst is approximately
spherical. It is often distorted by pressure, and portions
of the tumor may represent a mould of parts of the pelvic
or posterior abdominal walls.</p>

<p>The glandular cyst is usually unilateral. The proportion
of cases in which both ovaries are affected seems to
be about 4 per cent.</p>

<p>In some cases, when both ovaries are affected, the cysts
may become fused, so that a single tumor is formed, attached
by two distinct pedicles. Operation in such cases
is often very embarrassing.</p>

<p>The glandular cyst is the most common form of ovarian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
tumor. It may occur at any time of life from childhood
to old age. It is most common between the ages of
twenty and fifty.</p>

<p><b>Dermoid Cysts.</b>&mdash;A dermoid cyst of the ovary is characterized
by the presence of skin and cutaneous appendages.
Dermoid cysts are found in various parts of the
body, but they occur most frequently in the ovary. Of
188 dermoid cysts reported by Lebert, 129 occurred in
the ovary.</p>

<p id="DERMOID_CYSTS">Dermoid cysts comprise from 4 to 5 per cent. of all
ovarian tumors.</p>

<p>Simple ovarian dermoids are usually of small or moderate
size, varying from the size of a hen’s egg to that of
the adult head. The cysts rarely contain more than 8
pints of fluid.</p>

<p>Dermoid cysts may become larger by fusion with glandular
cysts or as the result of inflammation. Dermoid cysts
are usually unilateral; both ovaries are affected in about
20 per cent. of the cases. They are primarily unilocular.
Sometimes two or more dermoid cysts spring from the
same ovary, and these contemporaneous cysts may become
united, and the contiguous walls may atrophy so
that the cavities communicate.</p>

<p>Dermoid cysts of the ovary have been found at all ages&mdash;in
the fetus of eight months and in women over eighty
years of age. They are observed most frequently from
the fifteenth to the forty-fifth year.</p>

<p>The external appearance of the dermoid cyst differs
from that of the glandular cyst. It is dull and often
yellowish or brownish in color.</p>

<p>Upon the internal surface of the cyst is found a membrane
which looks like skin and which has a similar
structure. The skin may cover the whole of the surface
of the cavity, or it may be restricted to a small area, and
with the underlying tissue form a prominence of the cyst
wall&mdash;the so-called parenchyma body. This body is composed
of tissue derivatives of one, two, or all three layers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
of the blastoderm from the surface inward&mdash;the ectoderm,
mesoderm, and entoderm.</p>

<p>The following cutaneous appendages are found: hair,
sebaceous glands, sweat-glands, teeth, mammæ, horn,
nails. The cyst may also contain bone, unstriped muscle,
and tissue resembling brain-matter.</p>

<p>The hair may arise from the whole surface of the cyst,
or tufts of various length may be found growing from
slight prominences of the surface. The hair is usually
short; it is sometimes found, however, varying in length
from 4 or 5 inches to 5 feet.</p>

<p>There seems to be no relation between the color of the
hair of the dermoid and that upon the external surface
of the body of the individual. The hair in an ovarian
dermoid of a negress has been found of a blonde color.</p>

<p>The hair changes in color with age, and in an old
woman may become white.</p>

<p>The hair is constantly shed, and the cyst may contain
a large quantity of short loose hair mixed with the other
contents. Sometimes the shed hair is found rolled up in
balls of sebaceous matter.</p>

<p>Sebaceous glands and sweat-glands are usually numerous.</p>

<p>Teeth may be found free in the cyst-cavity, or they
may be attached to bone or cartilage within the cyst-wall,
while the crowns project into the cavity; or they may lie
completely imbedded in the wall. They are often well
formed, though they may be faulty in development and
shape. They are usually few in number, ranging from
one to ten. Many more teeth than this, however, are
sometimes found; in one case there were 300.</p>

<p>Mammæ are found in various degrees of development.
In some cases there are present one or more tags of skin
resembling a nipple. In others the mammæ may be well
formed and may contain glandular tissue.</p>

<p>The bones appear as delicate laminæ or spiculæ in the
cyst-wall. They often present a striking resemblance
to the flat bones of the skull and the jaw-bones.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span></p>

<p>The contents of a dermoid cyst vary in consistency.
All the substances discharged from the lining membrane
enter into their composition. They may consist of a
thick oily fluid of a yellowish or brown color, or a pultaceous,
semi-solid mass. They resemble the contents of
a wen or a sebaceous cyst. They are usually filled with
loose hairs and exfoliated epithelium. Though the fatty
contents may be in a fluid condition during life, yet they
solidify when exposed to the air and after death.</p>

<p>In some cases a dermoid cyst has been found in one
ovary while a glandular cyst was in the other. Again, a
single ovary may be the seat of a mixed tumor composed
of dermoid and glandular cysts. In most of such cases
the dermoid forms a single loculus of the tumor. Sometimes
the septum between the dermoid cavity and the
glandular cystic cavity atrophies and the two cavities
are thrown into one. Such an occurrence explains those
cases in which the cavity of a multilocular cyst is found to
be partly lined with skin which is continuous with the
cylindrical epithelium characteristic of the glandular
cyst.</p>

<p>The sebaceous glands and the sweat-glands in the walls
of an ovarian dermoid may become obstructed and
undergo cystic degeneration, forming in this way groups
of secondary cysts.</p>

<p>Dermoid cysts of the ovary are usually intra-peritoneal
in their growth, like the glandular cysts. In some cases,
however, they develop between the layers of the broad
ligament, and may assume any of the positions characteristic
of such extra-peritoneal growths.</p>

<p><i id="TERATOMA">Teratoma</i>, a very rare form of ovarian tumor, is an
atypical modification of the dermoid, the teratoma bearing
a relation to the dermoid similar to that of carcinoma
to adenoma. While in the dermoid the chief mass of the
tumor has a cystic character, the cystic cavity containing
the secretions from the lining epidermal tissue, the teratoma
is for the most part a solid tumor, and the productive
activity of the tissue is a cellular hyperplasia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span></p>

<p>They appear as pedunculated nodular tumors, with a
smooth surface, usually reaching a large or enormous size.
The substance of the tumor is composed of the dermoid
tissue spoken of, formed into irregular masses of various
size, form, color, and consistency, separated by connective-tissue
fasciculæ and infiltrated with small and minute
cysts (dilated glands or degenerated areas). The tumor
is characterized by an atypical arrangement, form, and
structure of the epithelium (after the type of a carcinoma)
and an excessive growth of embryonal connective
tissue (after the type of a sarcoma). It is extremely malignant,
being destructive and distributed by metastasis
and implantation.</p>

<p>The cause of dermoid tumors of the ovary is unknown.
Several different theories have been advanced, no one of
which seems to be generally acceptable.</p>

<h4 id="PAROOPHORITIC_CYSTS_OR_PAPILLOMATOUS_OVARIAN_CYSTS">PAROÖPHORITIC CYSTS, OR PAPILLOMATOUS OVARIAN CYSTS.</h4>

<p>There is an interesting variety of ovarian cysts which
is characterized by the presence of papillomata, or warts,
upon the inner surface. These cysts arise from the paroöphoron
or from the hilum of the ovary. Many theories
have been advanced to explain the origin of these tumors.
Pathologists are far from agreeing upon this subject.
Perhaps the most popular view among English and
American pathologists is that the papillomatous cysts
originate from the remains of the Wolffian body which
may persist in the paroöphoron in various stages of degeneration.</p>

<p>As paroöphoritic cysts spring from the hilum or the
attached portion of the ovary, and develop in the direction
of least resistance, they very often separate the
lamellæ of the mesovarium and invade the loose connective
tissue between the layers of the broad ligament.
These cysts are thus very often extra-peritoneal or intra-ligamentous
in their development.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span></p>

<p>Some writers of experience state that three-fourths of
all papillomatous tumors of the ovary are of intra-ligamentous
growth. This has not been the experience of
the author. The majority of the papillomatous ovarian
cysts that he has seen have been intra-peritoneal in development,
and have had as well-defined pedicles as the
ordinary multilocular ovarian cyst.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_168" src="images/fig_168.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 168.</span>&mdash;Papillomatous cyst of the paroöphoron. The section shows the
papillomatous growths in the interior and the relation of the oöphoron.</p></div>

<p><i>Cyst-wall.</i>&mdash;If the papillomatous cyst be intra-peritoneal
in development, two layers of tissue may be distinguished
in its wall: an outer dense layer, composed
of laminated connective tissue which sometimes contains
unstriped muscle-fibers; and an inner loose layer of
fibrous tissue. Both layers contain numerous blood-vessels.</p>

<p>If the cyst be extra-peritoneal or intra-ligamentous in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
its development, we find, in addition to the two layers just
described, an outer coat of peritoneum which is derived
from the broad ligament.</p>

<p>The internal surface of the cyst&mdash;the walls and the
papillæ&mdash;is covered by a single layer of cylindrical epithelial
cells, which may become flattened by pressure in
the large cysts. The epithelium is often ciliated.</p>

<p>Upon the interior of the papillomatous cyst are found
warts or papillary growths. These growths vary in size
from that of a grain of sand to that of the fetal head.
They may be scattered over the cyst-wall or collected in
groups. The larger growths often form arborescent,
cauliflower-like masses, which may be so numerous and
luxuriant that rupture of the cyst results.</p>

<p>In color the papillomata vary from whitish to dark
red or black, according to the vascular supply. They
are sometimes yellow as the result of fatty degeneration.
They are usually very vascular, and bleed freely when
manipulated.</p>

<p>The papillomata may be sessile or pedunculated. The
pedicle is sometimes very long and thin. Calcification
of the papillomata often takes place.</p>

<p>Papillary cysts are usually unilocular. In any case the
number of secondary loculi is much smaller than in the
glandular cyst.</p>

<p><i>Fluid Contents.</i>&mdash;The fluid contents of the papillomatous
cyst differ considerably from those of the glandular
cyst of the ovary.</p>

<p>In the papillomatous tumor the contents are usually
clear and of a watery consistency, with a specific gravity
of from 1005 to 1040. They are not often thick, mucous,
or gelatinous in consistency, as in the glandular cyst.
The color varies from light yellow to dark brown from
admixture of blood. As in all cystic tumors, the character
of the contents depends upon the accidents that
have happened during the growth of the cyst.</p>

<p>Papillomatous cysts are more often bilateral than any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
other cystic tumors of the ovary. They affect both ovaries
in from 50 to 75 per cent. of the cases. For this
reason the operator should always carefully examine the
second ovary after removing an ovarian cyst, for beginning
cystic degeneration may be found in it also.</p>

<p>Papillary cysts are usually of smaller size and of slower
growth than glandular cysts. The papillomata usually
perforate the cyst and invade the peritoneum before large
size has been attained. These tumors, therefore, are not
often seen of larger size than the adult head.</p>

<p>Though papillomatous cysts of the ovary are not as
common as the glandular cystomata, yet they are by no
means unusual. The statistics of operators vary a great
deal. In 600 ovariotomies Schroeder found 50 papillomatous
cysts&mdash;somewhat over 8 per cent. In the experience
of the writer they have been very much more
frequent than this.</p>

<p>The papillomatous cyst is the most dangerous cyst
affecting the ovary. The danger lies in metastasis of the
papillomatous growths to the general peritoneum. Metastasis
occurs from the perforation of the cyst-wall and
the escape into the peritoneum of the papillomatous
masses.</p>

<p>The tendency to rupture of the cyst-wall is one of the
characteristics of this form of tumor. The wall becomes
weakened by atrophy or fatty degeneration, or by direct
pressure of the luxuriant papillary growths. These
growths make their way to the outer surface of the cyst,
and extend thence throughout the peritoneum; or, if rupture
takes place, the cyst may become so inverted that the
site of each ovary is occupied by a mass of papillomata;
the formerly enclosing cyst has disappeared, and its remains
can be discovered only by careful dissection (<a href="#fig_169">Fig.
169</a>). Such a condition has undoubtedly often been mistaken
for primary papilloma of the ovary, the real origin
in a papillomatous cyst not having been detected.</p>

<p>The secondary affection of the peritoneum is due not
only to continuity of tissue, but to implantation and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
growth of portions of papillomata that have become
broken off and carried to different parts of the peritoneal
cavity. Such secondary growths may extend throughout
the whole abdomen from the pelvis to the diaphragm,
covering any of the viscera. They resemble in all respects
the original papillomata found in the interior of
the ovarian cyst. They sometimes form cauliflower-like
masses as large as the fist, and may be palpated through
the abdominal wall. They are very vascular, and bleed
profusely on being handled. The smallest particles of
papillomata are capable of infecting the peritoneum or
other tissues in this way.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_169" src="images/fig_169.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 169.</span>&mdash;Double papillomatous cyst of the ovary. The right cyst has ruptured
and is turned inside out, showing a mass of papillomata. Papillomata
have penetrated the wall of the left cyst. The peritoneum has been infected,
and a papillomatous growth appears on the fundus uteri.</p></div>

<p>The escape of a small quantity of the cyst-fluid into
the abdomen during the removal of the tumor may cause
subsequent recurrence in the peritoneum. Secondary
development of the growth in the abdominal cicatrix, or
its appearance in the site of puncture after tapping, is
due to the same cause.</p>

<p>Papillomata of the peritoneum are usually accompanied
by ascites. This is a prominent symptom in those cases
of papillomatous ovarian cyst in which secondary infection
of the peritoneum has taken place. In rare cases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
ascites is present, though perforation of the cyst and involvement
of the peritoneum cannot be detected.</p>

<p>Sometimes perforation of the cyst takes place into adjacent
organs, especially if the growth be intra-ligamentous.
In such cases the papillomatous masses may protrude
into the bladder, the rectum, or the cavity of the
uterus.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3 id="CYSTS_OF_THE_PAROVARIUM">CYSTS OF THE PAROVARIUM.</h3>

<p>The parovarium consists of a series of fine tubules
lying between the layers of the mesosalpinx. It may be
seen in the fresh specimen by holding the mesosalpinx
stretched between the eye and the light (<a href="#fig_145">Fig. 145</a>).</p>

<p>The typical parovarium consists of three parts: a series
of vertical tubules; a series of outer tubules free at one
extremity; and a larger longitudinal tubule.</p>

<p>The vertical tubules range from five to twenty-four in
number. They converge somewhat toward the ovary,
where they end in blind extremities and become closely
associated with the paroöphoron. At the other end they
terminate in the larger longitudinal tubule.</p>

<p>The series of outer tubules are called Kobelt’s tubes.
They are free and closed at the distal extremity, while at
the proximal extremity they join the longitudinal tubule.
The larger longitudinal tubule is called the duct of
Gärtner. It may sometimes be traced traversing the
broad ligament to the uterus, and through the walls
of this organ and of the vagina to its termination at the
urethra. It corresponds to the vas deferens in the male.
When persistent in the vaginal wall it may become the
starting-point of a vaginal cyst.</p>

<p>The vertical tubes of the parovarium are from 0.3 to
0.5 millimeters in diameter. They are occasionally found
lined with ciliated columnar epithelium. Usually they
contain a granular detritus representing the remains of
broken-down epithelium.</p>

<p>Cysts may arise from any of the parts of the parovarium.</p>

<p>Kobelt’s tubes frequently become distended, and form
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
small pedunculated cysts about the size of a pea. They
are of no clinical importance (<a href="#fig_145">Fig. 145</a>). They are often
observed in operations for ovarian disease, and are very
often mistaken for the hydatid or the cyst of Morgagni
which springs from the Fallopian tube, and which has
already been described.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_170" src="images/fig_170.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 170.</span>&mdash;Cyst of the parovarium. There is no distortion of the ovary. The
Fallopian tube has been much elongated.</p></div>

<p>The difference between these two varieties of small
cysts may be determined by careful examination of the
point of origin and by means of the microscope. Sutton
states that the cyst of Morgagni has muscular walls and
is lined by ciliated columnar epithelium. In the cyst of
Kobelt’s tubes the walls are fibrous and the lining is
cubical epithelium.</p>

<p>Large cysts of the parovarium originate from the vertical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
or the longitudinal tubules, and usually remain sessile
and develop between the layers of the mesosalpinx
and the broad ligament. As the cyst grows and separates
the layers of the mesosalpinx, it comes into close relationship
with the Fallopian tube. This structure, being
held by its uterine connection and the tubo-ovarian ligament,
becomes stretched across the surface of the cyst
and very much elongated. The elongation of the Fallopian
tube is a very constant accompaniment of parovarian
cysts. The tube may attain a length of 15 or 20
inches. The fimbriæ may also become much stretched
and elongated by the traction of the growing cyst, and
may attain a length of 4 inches.</p>

<p>The ovary is unaffected unless the cyst be of very large
size, in which case the ovary may be stretched upon the
surface of the cyst, so that its position becomes difficult
to determine.</p>

<p>There are two varieties of parovarian cyst&mdash;the simple
and the papillomatous.</p>

<p>The <i>simple parovarian cyst</i> has a very thin wall of uniform
thickness. In small cysts, less than the size of a
child’s head, the wall may be transparent. It is of a
light yellowish or greenish color, and the fine vessels
ramifying upon the surface are plainly visible. As one
would expect from the direction of growth, the outer covering
of the cyst is peritoneum, which is not adherent
and may be readily stripped off. The middle coat is
composed of fibrous tissue containing unstriped muscle.
The lining membrane is ciliated columnar epithelium,
stratified epithelium, or simple fibrous tissue, according
to the size of the cyst. The changes in the character of
the epithelium are due to pressure. The cyst-contents
are a clear, limpid, opalescent fluid of a specific gravity
below 1010.</p>

<p>In the <i>papillomatous parovarian cyst</i> the interior is
covered with warts or papillomatous growths resembling
in every respect those that occur in the cyst of the paroöphoron,
already described. The papillomatous parovarian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
cyst exhibits the same clinical features, and is liable
to the same accidents, as the paroöphoritic cyst. It may
become perforated and infect the general peritoneum.</p>

<p>The walls of the papillomatous parovarian cyst are somewhat
thicker than those of the simple parovarian cyst; the
fluid contents are not so clear and limpid, and may contain
altered blood that has escaped from the papillomata.</p>

<p>Parovarian cysts are almost invariably unilocular.
Only a few cases have been reported in which two or
more cavities were present.</p>

<p>The cysts are of small size, not often exceeding that
of a child’s head. They may, however, attain large dimensions
and contain several quarts of fluid.</p>

<p>Parovarian cysts are of very slow growth, and refill
but slowly after tapping or rupture. On account of the
thinness of the cyst-walls, these cysts seem especially
liable to the accident of rupture. Unless the cyst be
papillomatous, the bland, unirritating fluid is readily absorbed
by the peritoneum, and the cyst may remain quiescent
for a long period.</p>

<p>Cysts of the parovarium occur most frequently during
the period of active sexual life. Unlike dermoids and
cysts of the oöphoron, they are unknown in childhood.</p>

<p>Cysts of the parovarium are much less common than
cysts of the oöphoron and paroöphoron. In 284 tumors
of the ovary and parovarium operated upon by Olshausen,
about 11 per cent. originated in the parovarium.</p>

<p>Some authorities maintain that in rare instances dermoid
cysts may arise from the parovarium.</p>

<p>The symptoms of parovarian cysts resemble those of
ovarian cysts of similar development. On account of the
intra-ligamentous development of the tumor, pressure-symptoms
may appear early. The cyst is of such slow
growth that the simple parovarian cyst may exist for a
long time without giving any trouble whatever. The
slow growth is the only clinical feature that would enable
one to make a diagnosis between parovarian and ovarian
cyst.

<h3 id="NATURAL_HISTORY_AND_TREATMENT_OF_OVARIAN_CYSTS">NATURAL HISTORY AND TREATMENT OF OVARIAN CYSTS.</h3>

<p>In the discussion of the secondary changes, the clinical
history, and the treatment of cysts, the oöphoritic,
paroöphoritic, and parovarian cysts will be considered
together under the general heading of ovarian cysts.</p>

<h4 id="SECONDARY_CHANGES_OR_ACCIDENTS_OF_OVARIAN_CYSTS">SECONDARY CHANGES OR ACCIDENTS OF OVARIAN CYSTS.</h4>

<p>There are various accidents which may happen to an
ovarian cyst which have an important bearing on the
clinical course of the disease. These accidents are: inflammation
and suppuration; torsion of the pedicle; rupture
of the cyst.</p>

<p><b id="INFLAMMATION_AND_SUPPURATION">Inflammation and Suppuration.</b>&mdash;Inflammation of
an ovarian cyst is of very common occurrence. It seems
especially liable to happen in the small cysts of pelvic
growth. Ovarian dermoids are very often inflamed. The
inflammation may result in but a few peritoneal adhesions
between the outer surface of the cyst and some of the
contiguous structures, as a loop of intestine, the bladder,
the anterior abdominal wall, the omentum, etc., or the
whole cyst may be universally adherent, so that its removal
is rendered most difficult, and in some cases impossible.</p>

<p>The operator should always remember the possibility
of these adhesions in removing an ovarian cyst. Its surface
should be carefully examined as it is dragged slowly
through the abdominal incision, in order that slight
adhesions to delicate structures like the omentum and
the vermiform appendix may not be recklessly or unknowingly
torn.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

<p>The sources of inflammatory infection of an ovarian
cyst are the intestinal tract, the urinary bladder, and the
Fallopian tube. Perhaps salpingitis is the most frequent
cause of such inflammation. Infection often comes from
the vermiform appendix, which is frequently found adherent
to the surface of the tumor.</p>

<p>Old adhesions usually contain blood-vessels, which may
be of large size, especially if they arise from the intestine,
the omentum, or the uterus. In some cases in which the
tumor has become detached from the pedicle by rotation
or traction the adhesions have been sufficiently vascular
to maintain the vitality of the tumor.</p>

<p>Suppuration of ovarian cysts is sometimes seen. It
was more frequent in the period when these tumors were
treated by tapping, as infection occurred in this way.</p>

<p>Suppuration is most common in ovarian dermoids.
The tumor may become adherent to surrounding structures,
and may discharge its contents through the bladder,
the vagina, the rectum, or the abdominal wall. A tooth
thus discharged into the bladder from a suppurating dermoid
has in several instances formed the nucleus of a
vesical calculus.</p>

<p>A suppurating ovarian cyst sometimes contains gas,
either from communication with the intestine or from
decomposition of its contents. In such a case the usual
tumor-dulness is replaced by a tympanitic note.</p>

<p><b id="TORSION_OF_THE_PEDICLE_OR_AXIAL_ROTATION">Torsion of the Pedicle, or Axial Rotation.</b>&mdash;Ovarian
tumors occasionally rotate upon their axes, so that
the structures that form the pedicle become twisted. The
severity of the symptoms that arise from this accident
depends upon the degree of compression to which the
vessels of the pedicle are subjected from the torsion.</p>

<p>The accident is not now as common as formerly, because
the tumor is, as a rule, now removed as soon as it
is recognized, and many of the accidents that were described
as very frequent by the older writers are avoided.
The many recorded cases&mdash;chiefly of a date before our
present surgical era&mdash;show that axial rotation occurred in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
about 10 per cent. of the cases of ovarian and parovarian
tumors. Rokitansky found torsion of the pedicle in 12
per cent. of all cases of ovarian tumors, and in 6 per cent.
of the cases it was the cause of death.</p>

<p>The cause of axial rotation is unknown. It has been
attributed to alternate distention and evacuation of the
bladder, to the passage of feces through the rectum, and
to a sudden jar or motion of the body.</p>

<p>The accident is especially likely to occur when an
ovarian cyst complicates pregnancy or when both ovaries
are cystic. Torsion of both pedicles has been found in
women suffering with bilateral ovarian cysts.</p>

<p>Torsion of the pedicle is more apt to occur in cysts of
medium and small size than in the large tumors.</p>

<p>Torsion of the pedicle affects equally tumors of the
right and left sides. The direction of rotation is usually
toward the median line, though it may take place in the
reverse direction.</p>

<p>There is considerable variation in the amount of rotation.
In some cases the pedicle has twisted through but
half a circle, while in others twelve complete twists have
been found. A pedicle twisted in this way resembles a
rope. Such a high degree of torsion is the result of a
slow or chronic process. The rotation of the tumor takes
place so gradually, or the arrangement of the blood-vessels
in the pedicle is such, that no appreciable effect upon
the tumor is produced, and no symptoms arise from it.
The operator frequently meets examples of such slow
torsion in removing ovarian tumors. In extreme cases
the twisting progresses until the blood-supply through
the pedicle is arrested, and the cyst may become freed
from its peduncular attachment. If adhesions had formed
to the cyst-wall, the vitality may be maintained through
these channels; the tumor, in fact, becomes transplanted.
This phenomenon is most frequent with dermoids.</p>

<p>Very different are the phenomena of acute torsion.
Here the vascular supply of the tumor is so suddenly
and markedly interfered with that most urgent symptoms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
immediately arise. The interference with the circulation
depends upon the amount of the twist and the character
of the pedicle. The effect is first felt by the veins,
which are more compressible than the arteries; the venous
blood-current becomes obstructed, while the arteries
remain open. Venous engorgement of the cyst results;
extravasation of blood takes place in the walls, or the
veins may rupture and hemorrhage may take place into
the cyst-cavity. Death from acute anemia may result
from this cause. Thrombosis and necrosis of the tumor
may occur as a result of acute torsion.</p>

<p><b id="RUPTURE_OF_OVARIAN_CYSTS">Rupture of Ovarian Cysts.</b>&mdash;Rupture of an ovarian
cyst is an accident of not infrequent occurrence. It is
probable that small cysts rupture and refill without the
attention of the woman or the physician being directed to
the accident. The scars of old ruptures are frequently
found on the surface of ovarian cysts. Wells found rupture
of the cyst 24 times in a series of 300 ovariotomies.</p>

<p>There are various causes which predispose to rupture
or lead to it. As the cyst enlarges, the walls become
very thin as a result of the distention. The cyst-wall
may undergo, in places, retrograde changes&mdash;atrophy and
fatty degeneration. The wall may become weakened as
a result of suppuration, thrombosis, and the results of
torsion of the pedicle; and, as has already been said, papillomatous
growths destroy the integrity of the wall and
lead to perforation.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of the rupture is usually a sudden
jar or a fall. Sometimes very slight pressure is
enough to rupture the cyst. The manipulations of a
physician, turning in bed, and coughing have caused this
accident.</p>

<p>The effects of rupture depend upon the character of
the cyst-contents.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage may be profuse and rarely fatal. The
hemorrhage, however, is usually not severe, because the
rupture takes place in the attenuated part of the cyst,
which is but poorly supplied with blood-vessels.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

<p>If the fluid is unirritating to the peritoneum and contains
but little solid material, it is often readily absorbed
by the peritoneum and passed off by the kidneys. Large
quantities of fluid may be absorbed and eliminated in this
way. A case has been reported in which the rupture
of a cyst was followed by profuse diuresis which lasted
four days, during which time 65 pints of urine were discharged.</p>

<p>Another case has been reported in which the cyst ruptured
and refilled 34 times during a period of nine years.
The fluid on each occasion was absorbed by the peritoneum
and discharged by the kidneys without in any way
incapacitating the woman.</p>

<p>If the cyst-contents are septic, as is often the case in
dermoid cysts, fatal peritonitis will result. The danger
of rupture of the papillomatous tumors&mdash;general papillomatous
infection of the peritoneum&mdash;has already been
described.</p>

<p>Similar infection may rarely occur from the escape into
the peritoneum of the colloid contents of a ruptured
glandular cyst. After such an accident the peritoneum
has been found covered with tough gelatinous masses, of
a gray or yellow color, which reached the size of a hickory-nut.
This condition has been called <i>myxoma peritonæi</i>.</p>

<p>Very rare cases of similar metastasis from rupture of
dermoid cysts have been reported. In one case yellow
nodules the size of a pea, containing light-colored hair,
were found scattered upon the peritoneum.</p>

<p>It is probable that when the walls of an ovarian cyst
are very thin, slow transudation of the fluid into the
peritoneum takes place.</p>

<h4 id="THE_CLINICAL_HISTORY_OF_OVARIAN_CYSTS">THE CLINICAL HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYSTS.</h4>

<p>The symptoms produced by ovarian cysts depend upon
their size, their position, and the accidents that may arise.
If the tumor be intra-peritoneal in its development, the
woman’s attention is usually first directed to the pathological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
condition when the growth has attained sufficient
size to extend above the pelvis. The time of the perception
of the tumor depends upon the intelligence and
powers of observation of the woman and the thickness
of the abdominal wall. A cyst often attains a large size
and reaches well up into the abdomen before the woman
is aware of its existence. In the papillomatous cysts
sometimes the first symptoms that attract the woman’s
attention appear after the cyst has become perforated and
the peritoneum has become invaded by the papillomata.</p>

<p>Pain, except that due to pressure or inflammation or
some other accident, is not at all characteristic of ovarian
cysts.</p>

<p>If the cyst be intra-ligamentous in development, or if
it be wedged in the pelvis, the first symptoms of the disease
appear at an earlier date. The intra-ligamentous
tumors first separate the layers of the broad ligament;
they push the uterus to one side, and press upon the
bladder, ureters, and rectum. The disposition of the
peritoneum may be altered in a variety of ways by these
growths. They may grow altogether behind this membrane,
becoming retro-peritoneal, coming into immediate
relationship with the rectum; or they may pass behind
the cecum and the ascending colon, growing between
the layers of the mesocolon. They sometimes develop
more especially under the anterior layer of the broad
ligament, strip off the peritoneal covering of the bladder,
and come into immediate relationship with the anterior
abdominal wall; so that if laparotomy is performed, the
operator will enter the cavity of the cyst before he has
opened the general peritoneum. It is of the greatest importance
that the surgeon should be familiar with such
unusual ways of development of these tumors, as the operative
difficulties that are encountered are most embarrassing.</p>

<p>Pressure upon the ureters occurs not only in the cysts
of intra-ligamentous growth, but also in the large-sized
intra-peritoneal tumors. It is a frequent complication,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
and the hydronephrosis and kidney-degeneration that
result may be the immediate cause of death.</p>

<p>Doran says that in 32 cases out of 40 autopsies on
women with large ovarian tumors, kidney disease, probably
caused by pressure of the tumors, was present. The
writer has found a ureter distended to an inch in diameter
from pressure of a papillomatous cyst. The pressure of
the tumor sometimes produces edema of the lower extremities
and of the anterior abdominal walls.</p>

<p>The presence of ascites with cysts of papillomatous
nature has already been spoken of. Though this complication
is especially characteristic of these tumors, and
usually indicates peritoneal involvement, yet it is sometimes
found with the glandular and the dermoid cysts.
In these cases it is caused by the direct mechanical irritation
of the peritoneum by the movable tumor. It accompanies
also freely movable solid tumors of the ovary
and pedunculated fibroids of the uterus.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the gross disease of the ovaries, the
functions of the uterus are in no way specifically affected
by ovarian cysts. The uterus may be pushed to one
side, pressed backward into the hollow of the sacrum
or forward against the pubis, but menstruation may not
be affected, and conception may take place even with
tumors of very large size.</p>

<p>In some cases there is menorrhagia, or continuous
bleeding, which appears with the appearance of the cyst
and disappears after its removal. This phenomenon may
occur in old women who have long passed the menopause,
and may excite the suspicion of coincident malignant
disease of the uterus. On the other hand, menstruation
may be diminished or arrested.</p>

<p>Reflex disturbances in the breast may occur with ovarian
cysts, as in any form of ovarian disease. The areola
may become pigmented, the breasts swell, and a milky
secretion may be produced even in young girls.</p>

<p>Malignant degeneration may occur in any form of ovarian
cyst. It seems to be most frequent in the papillomatous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
tumors, next in the dermoids, and less frequent in
the glandular cysts.</p>

<p>The rapidity of growth of ovarian cysts varies a great
deal. The glandular tumors are of the most rapid development.
They sometimes attain a very large size
within a few months. The rate of accumulation of the
fluid depends upon the intracystic pressure, and is consequently
greatest immediately after rupture or tapping.
Some remarkable cases of great rapidity of accumulation
after tapping have been reported. In one case 90 pints
of fluid reaccumulated in seven weeks&mdash;a rate of about
2 pints a day. In another case 3½ pints of fluid were
accumulated every day.</p>

<p>The enormous size attained by ovarian cysts, and the
tremendous amount of fluid drawn off from them, are
shown by the old records of the days when tapping
the cyst was the only treatment. A few references will
illustrate this. In one case 1920 pints of fluid were
drawn off by 66 tappings in a period of sixty-seven
months. In another case 2787 pints were withdrawn by
49 tappings. In another case 9867 pounds were withdrawn
by 299 tappings. The fluid in these remarkable
cases must have been of low specific gravity, containing
but little solid matter, or the women would have sooner
succumbed from the drain on the system.</p>

<p>The misery of the women who were slowly crowded
out of existence by these enormous tumors, or who,
though with life prolonged by tapping, were exhausted
by the continuous drain, was depicted in their countenances.
The expression was called the <i>facies ovariana</i>.
We do not often see it at the present day. Wells describes
it thus: “The emaciation, the prominent or
almost uncovered muscles and bones, the expression of
anxiety and suffering, the furrowed forehead, the sunken
eyes, the open, sharply defined nostrils, the long, compressed
lips, the depressed angles of the mouth, and the
deep wrinkles curving around these angles, form together
a face which is strikingly characteristic.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span></p>

<p>The natural duration of life depends upon the character
of the ovarian tumor. A dermoid may exist from
childhood and give no trouble&mdash;in fact, may not be recognized
until some accident starts it into rapid development.
Even then it is of comparatively slow and limited
growth, and danger from it is due to the accidents, such
as inflammation and suppuration, to which it is especially
liable.</p>

<p>Though the papillomatous cyst is also of slow growth
when compared with the glandular cyst, yet the danger
here is due to peritoneal infection, which very often takes
place before the tumor has, by its size, begun to annoy
the woman.</p>

<p>The glandular cyst, however, is of rapid, continuous,
unlimited growth, and usually destroys the woman within
a period of three years. Life has been prolonged
for a much longer period in some cases by palliative
treatment and tapping. On the other hand, life may at
any time be cut short by the occurrence of some accident,
such as rupture or torsion of the pedicle.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms of the Accidents that occur in Ovarian Cysts.</i>&mdash;The
symptoms of inflammation are pain and tenderness
over the surface of the tumor. The tenderness is often
limited to a local area which marks the position of an
intestinal adhesion.</p>

<p>When suppuration takes place, the symptoms indicative
of the presence of pus appear&mdash;elevated temperature, rapid
and feeble pulse, exhaustion, and emaciation.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms of Torsion of the Pedicle.</i>&mdash;There are no
characteristic symptoms of slow or chronic torsion, unless,
perhaps, retardation of the growth of the tumor
appears as a result of the interference with the circulation.</p>

<p>The symptoms of acute torsion are, however, very
marked. The woman is seized with sudden and violent
pain in the abdomen, accompanied by vomiting and collapse.
Sometimes the abdomen becomes rapidly increased
in size on account of the venous engorgement of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
tumor. If a woman known to have an ovarian tumor
is thus attacked, the diagnosis of torsion of the pedicle
may be made. The diagnosis is rendered more probable
if the woman is also pregnant or if she has been recently
delivered. If the woman presents herself for the first
time to the physician with these acute symptoms, and he
finds by abdominal and pelvic examination that there is
an ovarian tumor, he should suspect that torsion of the
pedicle has occurred.</p>

<p><i>Rupture of the Cyst.</i>&mdash;Rupture of an ovarian cyst usually
follows a fall, a violent attack of coughing, vomiting,
etc.</p>

<p>The woman is seized with sudden pain in the abdomen,
with perhaps symptoms of collapse and loss of blood.</p>

<p>The shape of the abdomen becomes quickly altered
from that characteristic of encysted fluid to that characteristic
of free fluid in the peritoneum. The alteration
in shape is so marked that it may readily be perceived by
the patient.</p>

<p>These phenomena are followed by profuse diuresis, or
perhaps by symptoms of peritoneal inflammation.</p>

<p>If the woman survive, there is a gradual reaccumulation
of fluid and a return of the abdomen to the former shape.</p>

<p><b id="EXAMINATION">Examination.</b>&mdash;In the early stages of an ovarian cyst,
while it is in the pelvic state of development, bimanual
examination will reveal the condition. The tumor lies
to the side, to the front, or behind the uterus. The uterus
may be moved independently of the tumor. The
cystic character of the growth may often be determined
by palpation; fluctuation may be felt between the vaginal
finger and the abdominal hand. If the tumor be
intra-peritoneal, with a pedicle, it will be found to be
movable, and may be pushed out of the pelvis up into
the lower abdomen. If it be intra-ligamentous, the range
of motion is limited, the tumor is situated lower in the
pelvis, and is in closer relationship with the uterus.</p>

<p>The shape of the tumor is usually spherical. In a
multilocular cyst the surface may be lobulated; in a dermoid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
cyst the pultaceous character of the contents may
sometimes be determined by pressure with the vaginal
finger.</p>

<p>When the tumor has attained a sufficient size to have
extended into the abdomen, much may be determined by
careful abdominal examination. The woman should lie
upon the back, and all constricting clothing should be
removed. The whole abdomen should be exposed.</p>

<p>The bulging or prominence caused by the cyst is usually
apparent in a thin woman. It commonly occupies
the middle of the abdomen, but when not very large may
lie to either side.</p>

<p>Palpation reveals the smooth, spherical character of
the growth, or the lobulated surface from the presence of
secondary cysts. Perhaps an area of marked tenderness
may be discovered, which often shows the seat of peritoneal
inflammation and adhesion. In the papillomatous
tumors that have become perforated, irregular masses of
papillary growths may sometimes be felt through the
abdominal walls, situated either on the surface of the
tumor or in some other portion of the abdomen. The
association of such masses with a cystic tumor of the
ovary and ascites renders the diagnosis of papillary cysts
very certain.</p>

<p>If the tumor is non-adherent and of medium size, it may
be moved from side to side or upward in the abdomen.</p>

<p>Fluctuation may often be elicited by palpation, and
is most marked in the unilocular cysts with thin contents.
If the contents be thick, as in many of the glandular
cysts, or if the cyst be multilocular, fluctuation may
not be obtained. The wave of fluctuation is interfered
with by intervening septa.</p>

<p>Percussion reveals a central area of flatness which
marks the most prominent part of the tumor. Intestinal
resonance may be obtained above and to the sides of the
cyst, and in some cases below it. In instances of this
kind a central area of flatness is found surrounded by a
ring of resonance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span></p>

<p>This phenomenon is very different from that which
appears if the fluid accumulation is free in the peritoneum.
In the latter case the fluid gravitates to the flanks
when the woman is upon her back, and the intestines
float to the front, so that there is a central area of resonance,
with dulness to the sides. In the very unusual
cases in which gas is contained in the cyst-cavity the
area of flatness will be replaced by an area of a tympanitic
note.</p>

<p>If the woman sits up or lies on either side, the relation
between the areas of flatness and resonance is unaltered
in the case of an ovarian cyst, while, as is well known,
if the fluid be free it will gravitate to the most dependent
portion of the abdomen.</p>

<p>Auscultation reveals nothing of importance in regard
to ovarian tumors. It is of value in enabling one to make
a differential diagnosis between an ovarian tumor and
pregnancy.</p>

<p>Vaginal examination in the case of a large tumor shows
the character and the position of the lower portion of the
growth, and sometimes enables the physician to determine
upon which side the tumor had started. In ruptured
papillomatous cysts the papillary masses may sometimes
be felt behind the uterus when they cannot be
detected by the abdominal hand.</p>

<p>The details of the natural history and pathological
features already given will often enable the physician to
make a differential diagnosis among the different kinds
of ovarian cysts. Such a differential diagnosis, however,
is of no importance whatever, as all such tumors require
similar operative treatment.</p>

<p>To discuss the subject of the differential diagnosis of
ovarian cysts from other pelvic and abdominal tumors
would require a consideration of all the pathological
growths that may occur in the abdomen. About every
form of abdominal tumor has been mistaken for ovarian
cyst. Differential diagnosis is here also of but little importance
at the present day if the examiner is able to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
exclude pregnancy, phantom tumor, and fat. Operation
is indicated in practically all morbid growths of the abdomen,
with the exception of inoperable malignant disease;
no surgeon should undertake any abdominal operation
unless he is prepared to deal with any condition
that may be found.</p>

<p>The difficulty of making a differential diagnosis is well
illustrated by many cases that have been recorded, in
which it was impossible to determine the true nature of
the tumor even after the abdomen had been opened.</p>

<p>It is of the greatest importance to exclude pregnancy.
Many women have been subjected to the operation of
celiotomy because the pregnant uterus was mistaken for
an ovarian tumor. Women themselves often intentionally
mislead the physician, especially if the pregnancy is
illegitimate. They will even carry the deception so far
as to go upon the operating table with the full knowledge
that they have deceived the surgeon as to their condition.</p>

<p>The physician should always remember the possibility
of pregnancy in examining any form of abdominal tumor
in women. The mistakes that have happened have usually
been the result of carelessness or ignorance on the
part of the physician, though some of the most experienced
operators have made this error.</p>

<p>The separation of the uterus by bimanual examination
as distinct from the abdominal tumor is the most valuable
point in the differential diagnosis.</p>

<p>The complication of pregnancy with an ovarian cyst
renders the diagnosis more difficult.</p>

<p>It is easier to make a differential diagnosis between an
ovarian cyst and pregnancy than between some forms of
uterine fibroid and pregnancy.</p>

<p>Repeated examinations are often necessary. It is
always advisable, in any case, to make two or more examinations
before subjecting the woman to operation.
Much which was not at first apparent may be learned by
several days of watching and repeated examination.</p>

<p><i>Phantom tumor</i> is a rare condition. A woman imagines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
that she is suffering from a tumor and that her abdomen
is increasing in size. The condition is likely to occur at
the menopause, and there may readily be some physical
grounds for the woman’s suspicions, because there may
be a constantly increasing accumulation of fat in the abdominal
walls and the omentum.</p>

<p>The diagnosis is usually easily made. Careful palpation
and percussion fail to reveal any pathological mass
in the abdomen or any abnormal area of dulness. In
these cases the abdomen is often rendered prominent by
intestinal tympany. If any difficulty is experienced at
the examination, the woman should be etherized. If a
satisfactory diagnosis cannot be made, the case should be
watched. Several cases have been reported, and there
are probably many unreported, in which no tumor was
found after the abdomen had been opened.</p>

<p>A fat abdominal wall or omentum has often been mistaken
by the woman, and not infrequently by the physician,
for a tumor. These cases are often obscure; indeed,
all the difficulties of examination, in case a tumor be
present, are very much increased by the enormous deposits
of fat that are often present in the abdomens of
women.</p>

<p>Careful examination, sometimes with anesthesia, and,
if necessary, prolonged watching should be practised.
If a fold of the abdominal wall be picked up between
the hands, it will often show how much of the abdominal
enlargement is due to fat.</p>

<h4 id="TREATMENT_OF_OVARIAN_CYSTS">TREATMENT OF OVARIAN CYSTS.</h4>

<p><b>Tapping.</b>&mdash;At one time the universal method of treating
cystic tumors of the ovary was by tapping, or puncture
through the abdominal wall. Many women were
subjected to this proceeding a very great number of
times, and, though not cured, were enabled to drag on a
miserable existence until death resulted from exhaustion
or from some accident to the cyst. In a few cases the
cyst refilled very slowly, relief being experienced for several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
years before a second tapping became necessary. In
still fewer cases the tapping seemed to be curative, the
tumor never reappearing after it had been evacuated.
Such cases were so unusual that they should have no influence
whatever in determining the method of treatment.
In the great majority of instances the cyst rapidly refilled.
Sometimes the fluid accumulated with such rapidity
that evacuation became necessary every few days.
Referring again to the old records, we find a case which
was tapped 664 times in thirteen years&mdash;once in about
seven days!</p>

<p>If the cyst were multilocular, tapping furnished but
partial relief.</p>

<p>The proceeding itself was attended by serious dangers.
Dr. Fock of Berlin in 1856 stated that 25 out of 132
women&mdash;or 1 in 5½&mdash;died within some hours or a few
days after the first tapping. Another operator lost 9 out
of 64 cases&mdash;or very nearly 1 in 7&mdash;within twenty-four
hours after the first tapping. The chief mortality occurred
in the cases of multilocular tumors. Tapping
the unilocular tumors was attended by much less danger.</p>

<p>The sources of danger from tapping were the following:
hemorrhage from puncture of a vessel in the cyst-wall;
septic or other infection of the peritoneum; and inflammation
or suppuration of the cyst.</p>

<p>The majority of the women died in consequence of
peritoneal infection.</p>

<p>The danger arose not only from septic infection of the
peritoneum, but from papillomatous or other infection
from the escape into the peritoneal cavity of some of the
cyst-contents. Reference has already been made to the
occurrence of the papillomatous infection at the site of
puncture in the abdominal wall.</p>

<p>At the present day tapping an ovarian cyst with the
hope of cure is never practised.</p>

<p>Tapping as a palliative procedure should never be performed.
The dangers that may result from the tapping
cannot be disregarded, and no hope whatever of cure can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
be held out to the patient. When operation is finally
performed, it is rendered much more difficult from the
adhesions that have resulted from previous tappings.</p>

<p><b>Operation.</b>&mdash;The treatment of ovarian cysts is operative.
Celiotomy should be performed and the tumor removed
without delay. The dangers due to the accidents
that may occur show the risk of waiting after a diagnosis
has been made. When the tumor is small the operative
complications and dangers are at a minimum.</p>

<p>Even if the tumor be discovered accidentally by the
physician, and has never given any trouble to the woman,
operation for its removal should be advised. A dermoid
that has existed for years may suddenly endanger
the woman’s life. Delay in the case of papillomatous
tumors&mdash;and no one can determine in the early stages
whether or not a cyst be papillomatous&mdash;is especially
dangerous. About one-half the women upon whom I
have operated for papillomatous cysts have come to me
after the peritoneum had become infected. Though the
peritoneum be extensively involved, operation is by no
means hopeless. As in the case of tuberculosis of the
peritoneum, so in papilloma, the opening and draining
of the abdominal cavity may result in cure.</p>

<p>Pregnancy is no contraindication to operation. In fact,
the dangers of obstructed labor, of rupture of the cyst,
and of torsion of the pedicle urgently call for immediate
operation in such cases. Pregnancy usually progresses to
full term after operation.

<h3 id="SOLID_TUMORS_OF_THE_OVARY">SOLID TUMORS OF THE OVARY.</h3>

<p>Solid tumors of the ovary are of rare occurrence.
They are said to be found in about 5 per cent. of all the
cases of ovarian tumors that are submitted to operation.</p>

<p>The solid tumors of the ovary are fibromata, myomata,
sarcomata, carcinomata, and papillomata.</p>

<p><b id="FIBROMATA">Fibromata.</b>&mdash;Ovarian fibromata are very rare; they are
histologically similar to fibroid tumors of other parts of
the body. They do not form circumscribed new growths,
but affect the whole organ, which becomes uniformly hypertrophied,
preserving its general shape and anatomical
relations. The tumor may contain, between the bundles
of fibrous tissue, small cavities filled with fluid. The
growth is usually intra-peritoneal and has a well-formed
pedicle; it may, however, in exceptional cases be extra-peritoneal
and develop between the layers of the broad
ligament. In such a case there is difficulty in determining
whether the fibroid originated in the uterus or in the
ovary. Ovarian fibromata are usually of small size and
slow growth. A case has been reported in which the
tumor weighed over 7 pounds.</p>

<p><i>Corpora Fibrosa.</i>&mdash;A variety of the ovarian fibromata
are the corpora fibrosa, which are due to fibroid degeneration
of the corpus luteum. They are tough, fibrous
bodies, about the size of a pea, which are occasionally
found upon the surface of the ovary. It is said that they
may attain the size of a child’s head. They are usually,
however, very small, and have no clinical significance.</p>

<p><b id="MYOMATA">Myomata.</b>&mdash;Ovarian myomata are composed chiefly
of unstriped muscular fiber. They are somewhat more
frequent than the pure fibromata. The two growths may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
be mixed, forming a fibro-myomatous tumor. The myomatous
tumor may attain the weight of fifteen pounds.</p>

<p><b id="SARCOMATA">Sarcomata.</b>&mdash;The majority of solid tumors of the
ovary are sarcomatous in character, and it seems probable
that many tumors that are classed as fibroids or
fibro-myomata are in reality ovarian sarcomata. The
growth may be either of the spindle-cell or the round-cell
variety. Occasionally it is an endothelioma, a form
of sarcoma developing from the endothelial cells of the
blood- and lymph-vessels.</p>

<p>Sarcoma of the ovary differs from sarcoma in other
parts of the body in the fact that it is very often bilateral.
Sutton states that both ovaries are affected in about 20
per cent. of the cases. Other observers state that ovarian
sarcomata are usually bilateral.</p>

<p>The surface of the tumor is smooth, and the general
form and anatomical relations of the ovary are unaltered.
Ovarian sarcomata are usually of median size, though
they may attain enormous proportions and fill the abdominal
cavity.</p>

<p>The tumor is usually of rapid growth; in one case it
attained a weight of ten pounds within a period of six
months. The growth is accelerated by pregnancy. Ascites
is commonly present with ovarian sarcoma, and
cachexia may appear rapidly.</p>

<p>Ascites caused by peritoneal irritation may accompany
any of the solid tumors of the ovary, as other
kinds of freely movable abdominal tumor. It is, however,
especially characteristic of the ovarian sarcomata,
and is a point of diagnostic importance.</p>

<p>Ovarian sarcomata differ from the fibroid and the myomatous
tumors in rapidity of growth, involvement of both
ovaries, and the presence of ascites. Ovarian sarcomata
may occur at any age. They are relatively very frequent
in children. An analysis of 60 cases of ovarian tumors
in children collected by Sutton shows that sarcomata occurred
16 times.</p>

<p>The symptoms caused by ovarian fibromata, myomata,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
and sarcoma are those referable to pressure and peritoneal
irritation. These tumors, on account of their
moderate size and great mobility, seem to be especially
liable to torsion of the pedicle. They should be removed
by celiotomy as soon as recognized.</p>

<p>Both ovaries should always be carefully examined, for
in sarcoma the disease is often bilateral.</p>

<p><b id="CARCINOMATA">Carcinomata.</b>&mdash;Primary cancer of the ovaries is very
rare. Secondary infection of these organs is, however,
of not infrequent occurrence. It is found in cases of
cancer of the breast and of the uterus. In 29 cases of
death from cancer of the breast, both ovaries were found
to be involved in 3 cases.</p>

<p>Primary cancer of the ovary appears as a solid or a
cystic tumor. The solid carcinomata are diffuse infiltrations
of the ovarian tissue, forming pedunculated, rarely
intraligamentous, ovoid or globular tumors having a
smooth or slightly irregular surface. They are either of
the medullary or scirrhous type. The medullary form is
of rapid growth, and may reach the size of the adult head.
The scirrhous form is of comparatively slow growth and
smaller size, and in consistency resembles a fibroma.</p>

<p>The cystic carcinomata are similar in form to the multilocular
glandular cysts, but are smaller, rarely reaching
a greater size than that of the adult head. They are
adeno-carcinomata or papillary adeno-carcinomata. The
surface of the tumor, its walls, and the septa contain to
a greater or less extent solid nodules or plates of various
size composed of carcinomatous tissue. The nodules
often have a papillary character.</p>

<p>Ovarian carcinoma is usually a bilateral growth. Unlike
carcinoma in other parts of the body, it may, particularly
the medullary form, occur in childhood. It is
usually found between the ages of thirty and sixty years.
Ascites is commonly present in cancer of the ovaries, the
fluid being often tinged with blood; as the disease develops,
edema of the lower limbs and cachexia appear.</p>

<p>Cancer of the ovary is an extremely malignant growth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
quickly extending to surrounding structures as implantations
on the peritoneum, and by metastasis to distant
organs. In more than 75 per cent. of the cases operated
upon the disease has returned and terminated in death
within the first year.</p>

<p>When cancer of the ovaries is secondary to cancer elsewhere
than in the uterus, operation offers no prospect of
cure. If the disease is secondary to cancer of the uterus,
it may be possible to remove all of the affected structures.</p>

<p><b id="OVARIAN_PAPILLOMATA">Ovarian Papillomata.</b>&mdash;Superficial papillomata of the
ovary are of very rare occurrence. In many of the cases
in which the papillomata appear to grow from the surface
of the ovary there had previously been a papillomatous
cyst of paroöphoritic origin, which had become perforated
and perhaps inverted, so that, after the cyst had become
destroyed, the growths appeared to spring from the ovarian
surface. Careful dissection and search for the remains
of the old cyst should always be made in such
cases.</p>

<p>In superficial papilloma of the ovary the growths are
in all respects similar to those found in the interior of
papillomatous cysts. They may be isolated upon the
surface of the ovary, or they may cover it so completely
that the ovary is hidden from view. A section, however,
will reveal the ovary lying in the centre of the growth.</p>

<p>The papillomata may be pedunculated or sessile. They
vary in size. In some cases they form a mass larger than
the adult fist.</p>

<p>The disease is often bilateral. Secondary involvement
of the peritoneum occurs, as in the case of papillomatous
cyst. The course of the disease is similar to that of a
perforated papillomatous cyst. The treatment is immediate
celiotomy and removal. As in the case of
papillomatous cysts, involvement of the peritoneum is
no contraindication to operation.</p>

<p><b id="TUBERCULOSIS_OF_THE_OVARY">Tuberculosis of the Ovary.</b>&mdash;Tuberculosis of the
ovary is usually secondary to tuberculosis of the Fallopian
tubes. In tuberculosis of the peritoneum the ovaries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
are often found to be involved, in some cases without accompanying
disease of the tube. In phthisical women
the ovaries have been found, in rare instances, to be the
only portion of the genital apparatus in which secondary
deposit of tubercles took place.</p>

<p>Williams states that primary tuberculosis of the ovaries
has not yet been described.</p>

<p>The surface of the ovary may be covered with miliary
tubercles, or they may be scattered through the substance
of the gland. In other cases the ovary contains cavities
filled with cheesy material or pus, forming a tuberculous
abscess.</p>

<p>There are no characteristic symptoms of tuberculosis
of the ovaries. The condition is usually found at operation
or at autopsy, associated with tuberculosis of the
peritoneum or of some other part of the genital organs,
as the Fallopian tubes and the uterus.</p>

<p>The treatment consists in oöphorectomy, unless operation
is contraindicated on account of extensive involvement
of other structures.</p>

<p><b id="TUMORS_OF_THE_OVARIAN_LIGAMENT">Tumors of the Ovarian ligament.</b>&mdash;Fibroid and
sarcomatous tumors have occasionally been found in the
ovarian ligament. Doran has reported a fibroid of the
ovarian ligament that weighed 17 pounds. The writer
has removed a sarcoma of the ovarian ligament that
weighed 5 pounds.</p>

<p>It is impossible to distinguish these tumors from similar
growths of the ovary. They demand like treatment.

<h3 id="MALFORMATIONS_OF_THE_GENITAL_ORGANS">MALFORMATIONS OF THE GENITAL ORGANS.</h3>

<p>Congenital malformations are found in all parts of
the genital tract. Some of the more common forms, like
arrested development of the uterus, have been referred to
in the previous pages. Others will briefly be considered
here. Reference to the method of development of the
sexual organs will elucidate this subject.</p>

<p>The Fallopian tubes, the uterus, and the vagina are
developed from two embryonic structures called the ducts
of Müller. These ducts become fused, first at the lower
extremity, between the sixth and eighth weeks of fetal
life (<a href="#fig_175">Fig. 175</a>). The early genital tract thus formed is
consequently divided throughout by a septum, which
normally disappears during fetal development, so that
there results one vaginal and uterine tract, from which
the Fallopian tubes branch.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_175" src="images/fig_175.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 175.</span>&mdash;Diagrams showing the development of the vagina and the uterus
from Müller’s ducts.</p></div>

<p>The most important malformations of the vagina and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
the uterus arise from arrest, at any stage, of this normal
developmental process.</p>

<p>Very rarely the uterus is completely absent, or it may
be represented by a small band of muscular and connective
tissue stretched across the pelvis. In other cases the
cervix is well formed, while the body of the uterus is but
poorly developed.</p>

<p>We have seen that this condition is often associated with
pathological anteflexion of the uterus.</p>

<p><b id="UTERUS_UNICORNIS">Uterus Unicornis.</b>&mdash;Sometimes there is arrest in the
development of one of Müller’s ducts, so that the uterus
becomes one-sided or one-horned and presents only one
formed Fallopian tube. In such a case both ovaries may
be present.</p>

<p><b id="UTERUS_DIDELPHYS">Uterus Didelphys.</b>&mdash;Müller’s ducts may unite only as
far as the top of the vagina, no fusion whatever taking
place in the uterine portion. In such a case two separated
uterine bodies are produced; the condition of double
uterus exists (<a href="#fig_176">Fig. 176</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_176" src="images/fig_176.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 176.</span>&mdash;Uterus didelphys and double vagina.</p></div>

<p><b id="UTERUS_BICORNIS_DUPLEX">Uterus Bicornis Duplex.</b>&mdash;In this variety of malformation
development has proceeded a step farther than in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
preceding variety. The uterine bodies have become externally
united. There is, however, no fusion of the
cavities. Two cavities are present, opening into a double
vagina.</p>

<p><b id="UTERUS_BICORNIS_UNICOLLIS">Uterus Bicornis Unicollis.</b>&mdash;Here the development
of the cervix and the lower part of the uterus is normal.
The upper parts of the body of the uterus have not become
fused, and diverge sharply from each other. The
organ is two-horned (<a href="#fig_177">Fig. 177</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_177" src="images/fig_177.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 177.</span>&mdash;Uterus bicornis unicollis (Winckel).</p></div>

<p><b id="UTERUS_CORDIFORMIS">Uterus Cordiformis.</b>&mdash;In this variety the two halves
of the uterus are united throughout. Externally on the
fundus there appears a slight depression, which, with the
broad body of the uterus, demonstrates the imperfection
of development. The name is derived from the resemblance
to the conventional heart-shape.</p>

<p><b id="UTERUS_SEPTUS">Uterus Septus.</b>&mdash;In this variety development has progressed
so far that externally the uterus presents the normal
appearance. The septum that divides the two ducts
has, however, failed to disappear, and a divided uterus
results. The septum may extend throughout the body
of the uterus, or it may be less perfectly formed. Often
one side of the uterus is better developed than the other
(<a href="#fig_178">Fig. 178</a>).</p>

<p><b id="MALFORMATION_OF_THE_VAGINA">Malformation of the Vagina.</b>&mdash;Malformation of the
vagina is frequently present with malformation of the uterus.
The septum that divides Müller’s ducts may persist
throughout the whole length of the vagina, forming
a double vagina; or the septum may have partly disappeared,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
being present in various stages of perfection.
In double vagina each orifice may be guarded by a distinct
hymen.</p>

<p>Sometimes one of the canals of a double vagina is
much better developed than the other. The orifice of
the poorly developed canal may be closed at its lower
extremity, so that the malformation is never recognized
by the woman or physician unless the closed canal becomes
distended with blood or other secretion. A variety
of vaginal cyst may be formed in this way.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_178" src="images/fig_178.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 178.</span>&mdash;Uterus septus (Cruveilhier).</p></div>

<p><i>Unilateral Vagina.</i>&mdash;In this variety of malformation
one of the ducts of Müller fails to develop at all. The
condition always occurs with uterus unicornis. The
vaginal canal is smaller than normal and may be situated
to one side of the median line.</p>

<p><i>Absence of the vagina</i> rarely occurs. There may be no
sign whatever of this structure, or it may be represented
by a fibrous cord. The external genitals may also be
absent, or they may be well developed.</p>

<p>If the uterus and ovaries are well developed, much
trouble may arise from retention of menstrual blood.</p>

<p>An attempt should be made, by means of a transverse
incision between the rectum and the urethra, to reach the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
cervix, and, if possible, to make an artificial vagina by
transposition of skin from the buttocks. Such treatment
is usually unsatisfactory, as a patulous canal cannot be
maintained. It may be necessary to remove the uterus
and appendages.</p>

<p>Sometimes the vagina is absent in only part of its
course, being open below and
represented above by a fibrous
cord; or the upper and lower
portions may be developed,
while the middle portion is
imperforate.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_179" src="images/fig_179.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 179.</span>&mdash;Transverse septum of
the vagina (Heyder).</p></div>

<p>These conditions are more
amenable to operative treatment
than in the case of complete
absence of the vagina.
The intervening septum should
be incised, and the patulous
condition maintained by the
passage of bougies if necessary.</p>

<p>Sometimes the lumen of the vagina is obstructed by
the presence of transverse bands or crescentic folds, which
have been described as supplementary hymens (<a href="#fig_179">Fig. 179</a>).</p>

<p>A <i>hematocolpos</i> is produced when the vagina becomes
distended with menstrual blood above such an obstruction.</p>

<p><b id="HERMAPHRODITISM">Hermaphroditism.</b>&mdash;A true hermaphrodite is an individual
who possesses the organs of both sexes in a condition
of perfect function. The existence of true hermaphroditism
is denied by many authorities of the present
day, though the older writers firmly believed in it. The
coexistence of testicles and ovaries has never been proved
beyond doubt in the human subject. It is doubtful if
there are any cases, recorded as true hermaphrodites, in
which the demonstration of the condition is not open to
serious criticism; such individuals are in reality pseudo-hermaphrodites.
The term hermaphrodite is still, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
very commonly applied to any individual of doubtful
sex.</p>

<p>A <i>pseudo-hermaphrodite</i> is possessed of a distinct sex,
and has either ovaries or testicles, though the external
genitals and other secondary sexual characteristics may
present the appearance of a double sex.</p>

<p>In <i>male pseudo-hermaphroditism</i> the individual has
testicles, and the external genital organs simulate those
of the female.</p>

<p>In <i>female pseudo-hermaphroditism</i> the individual has
ovaries, and the external genital organs simulate those
of the male.</p>

<p>In male pseudo-hermaphroditism the condition of
hypospadias is usually present, the lower surface of the
urethra and the perineum being split. The penis may
be very small and imperforate, the urethra opening at its
base. The fissure of the perineum closely resembles the
vagina, and the split scrotum may be mistaken for the
labia. Cases of this kind are on record in which the individuals,
ignorant of their true sex, have for years indulged
in sexual connection with men.</p>

<p>In female pseudo-hermaphroditism there is hypertrophy
of the clitoris and the prepuce, with approximation of the
labia majora and contraction or occlusion of the ostium
vaginæ, giving the genitals the appearance of the masculine
type.</p>

<p>The secondary sexual characteristics of both varieties
of pseudo-hermaphrodites&mdash;the distribution of hair,
mammary development, shape, voice, etc.&mdash;are usually
of the feminine type.</p>

<p>It is often exceedingly difficult to determine during life
the true sex of the individual in cases of hermaphroditism.
The only absolute test of the sex is the determination
of the genital glands.</p>

<p>The labia should be carefully palpated to determine
whether or not testicles are present. Rectal examination
should be made to determine the existence of uterus or
ovaries. The sexual inclinations of the individual should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
be observed. The discharge from the genitals during
sexual excitement should be examined for spermatozoa.</p>

<p>The presence of a uterus is not necessarily indicative
of a female, as a uterus may be associated with a perfect
penis and testes; and a periodic discharge of blood from
the genitals has been found in men.</p>

<p>If conception occurs, of course, all doubt is removed.
If the sex cannot be definitely determined by such examination,
it is best to consider the case one of male pseudo-hermaphroditism,
which is the usual form, and to treat
the individual as a male.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<h3 id="DISORDERS_OF_MENSTRUATION">DISORDERS OF MENSTRUATION.</h3>

<p>Menstruation, or the regular periodical discharge of
blood from the uterus, is a phenomenon that occurs only
in the human race and in some monkeys. The anatomical
changes that accompany menstruation have not yet
been definitely determined. In some species of monkey&mdash;<i>Semnopithecus
entellus</i> and <i>Macacus rhesus</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>&mdash;the following
changes appear to take place at the menstrual
periods: The endometrium first becomes swollen and
congested as a result of the growth of the stroma, and
increase in the number and size of the blood-vessels. The
vessels in the superficial part of the stroma degenerate
and break down, and blood is extravasated into the
meshes of the stroma network. The extravasated blood
collects into lacunæ which lie close beneath the uterine
epithelium. Finally the lacunæ rupture and the blood
escapes into the cavity of the uterus, forming the menstrual
clot. Then a fresh epithelium grows over the torn
surfaces, new blood-vessels are formed, the stroma shrinks,
and the endometrium of the intermenstrual period is
restored.</p>

<p>Nothing is known with any degree of certainty regarding
the cause and significance of menstruation.
There is much diversity of opinion in regard to the coincidence
of ovulation and menstruation. Heape has
shown that for monkeys ovulation and menstruation are
not necessarily coincident; in forty-two menstruating
specimens of <i>S. entellus</i> not one had a recently discharged
follicle in either ovary. In monkeys, therefore, menstruation
may take place without ovulation, and it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
probable that the same is true for the human female.
Ovulation and conception may occur in the human female
when menstruation is absent; pregnancy not infrequently
occurs during the amenorrhea associated with lactation,
and in India, where the girls are married at a very young
age, pregnancy and child-birth occur before menstruation
has begun.</p>

<p>Leopold (quoted by Hirst) in an examination of twenty-nine
pairs of ovaries removed on successive days up to
the thirty-fifth after a menstrual period, found a Graafian
follicle bursting on the eighth, twelfth, fifteenth,
sixteenth, eighteenth, twentieth, and thirty-fifth days
after the menstrual period. Thus ovulation frequently
occurred without menstruation during the intermenstrual
interval. In five cases there was no ovulation at the
menstrual period, or menstruation occurred without ovulation.</p>

<p>It seems probable, therefore, that the ripening of the
ovum in the ovary is independent of the process of menstruation,
though the increased blood-supply to the generative
organs during menstruation may, to a certain
extent, determine the time of ovulation when a sufficiently
ripe ovum is present.</p>

<p>Though menstruation in women is analogous to the
rut or “heat” of other animals, yet there are some points
of difference: The lower mammals breed only at times
of “heat,” and these times of “heat” occur in the wild
state only at certain periods of the year, which are dependent
upon climatic conditions, the young being born
at the season of the year best suited for their survival.
Some domestic animals, like the cow, probably as a result
of domestication, have no regular breeding time. In the
lower mammals “heat” and ovulation appear to be coincident,
and these are the only periods during which the
female seems normally to have any sexual desire.</p>

<p>The monkeys examined by Heape menstruated throughout
the year and yet seemed in the free state to have
definite breeding times.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

<p>The human female, with but few exceptions, menstruates
throughout the year and may breed at any time.
The exceptions in the case of the human female are of
interest. Dr. Frederick A. Cook,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> ethnologist to the first
Peary North Greenland Expedition, says of the Esquimaux
living in the extreme north, from the seventy-sixth
to the seventy-ninth parallels of latitude: “The passions
of these people are periodical, and their courtship is usually
carried on soon after the return of the sun; in fact,
at this time they almost tremble from the intensity of
their passions, and for several weeks most of their time
is taken up in gratifying them. Naturally enough, then,
the children are usually born at the beginning of the
Arctic night.” In Queensland the natives are also said
to have a special breeding season.</p>

<p>Menstruation usually begins in this country at the fourteenth
year. The time of the first appearance of the
process is influenced by race, climate, and environment.
As a rule, it begins earlier in warm climates and later in
cold climates. It is earlier in girls who lead luxurious,
indolent lives than in girls of the working classes.</p>

<p>During the first year or two of menstrual life menstruation
is often very irregular. It may be absent for several
months after its first appearance, or recur at varying
intervals before it becomes regularly established. Irregularity
at this time calls for no treatment.</p>

<p><i>Precocious menstruation</i> rarely occurs at a very early
age. It has been known to begin, and to recur with
regularity, from the time of birth. In such cases there
is a corresponding premature development of the sexual
organs.</p>

<p>The <i>menstrual discharge</i> consists of blood, mucous
secretion from the uterus and vagina, and epithelial cells
from the endometrium.</p>

<p>The normal duration of the flow is from two days to a
week. The amount of fluid discharged is from 2 to 9
ounces. Menstruation occurs every twenty-eight days,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
counting from the beginning of one period to the beginning
of another. The menstrual interval is subject to
considerable individual variations, which appear to be
within the limits of health. It sometimes occurs with
regularity every two, three, or five weeks. When it
occurs every two weeks, the alternate flows are often
but small in amount. The occurrence of, or the attempt
at, menstruation every two weeks, in a woman who had
previously menstruated monthly, is sometimes a symptom
of beginning uterine disease.</p>

<p>Menstruation commonly ceases at about the forty-fifth
year, when the menopause appears.</p>

<p>Most of the disorders of menstruation have already
been considered as symptoms of the various lesions of
the genital organs that have been described in the previous
pages.</p>

<p>There are some disorders of menstruation, however,
often unaccompanied by discoverable lesions, which now
demand consideration.</p>

<p><b id="AMENORRHEA">Amenorrhea.</b>&mdash;Amenorrhea is the absence of menstruation.
Failure of the menstrual blood to be discharged
from the vagina, such as occurs in cases of
atresia, is not necessarily amenorrhea; menstruation may
have taken place, though the most marked phenomenon
of this process, the discharge of blood, is concealed.</p>

<p>The term primary amenorrhea, or <i>emansio mensium</i>,
is applied to those cases in which menstruation has never
appeared. Secondary amenorrhea, or <i>suppressio mensium</i>,
is applied to those cases in which menstruation has
ceased after having once been established.</p>

<p>Amenorrhea is due to defective development of the
organs of generation; to premature atrophy, such as
occurs in superinvolution of the uterus; to lesions,
pathological and traumatic; to acute and chronic general
diseases; and to psychical disturbances.</p>

<p>Menstruation is often absent during the acute diseases,
such as typhoid fever, and it may remain suppressed
until the general health is fully restored.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span></p>

<p>Amenorrhea may also occur in any chronic debilitating
condition. It is common in chlorosis, anemia, phthisis,
and malaria.</p>

<p>It frequently results from changes of climate and surroundings,
and continues until the person becomes
adapted to the new environment. It is seen in emigrants
from other countries, and in women who move
from the country to large cities. It is often caused by
overwork, physical and mental, and by insufficient food.
It is not uncommon in studious school-girls.</p>

<p>Amenorrhea is sometimes due to the excessive general
development of fat, even in young woman who are apparently
in good general health.</p>

<p>Amenorrhea is frequently associated with insanity. It
may be caused by fright, grief, or anxiety. The fear of
pregnancy after illicit coitus sometimes produces it.</p>

<p>In some unusual cases amenorrhea is present without
any discoverable cause. The woman may be in perfect
general health, and the sexual organs may be well developed,
at least so far as can be determined by physical
examination.</p>

<p>In amenorrhea there is often a general periodical disturbance
that marks the times at which the menstrual
bleeding should occur. There may be headache, flashes
of heat, nervousness, nausea and vomiting, and a feeling
of fulness and pain in the pelvis. Various cutaneous
eruptions may occur as the result of amenorrhea, as in
other diseases of the genital apparatus.</p>

<p>The poor health, mental and physical, that usually accompanies
amenorrhea is often thought by the patient
and her friends to be the result, rather than the cause&mdash;as
it really is&mdash;of the arrested bleeding.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The treatment of amenorrhea depends
upon the cause of the condition. Little, if any, benefit
is to be expected in those cases due to defective development
of the uterus or the ovaries. If an attempt at menstruation
is made, as shown by periodical local pain and
general disturbance, and the uterus is found to be small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
and sharply anteflexed, benefit may sometimes result from
thorough dilatation of the cervix.</p>

<p>Most cases of amenorrhea demand general treatment.
The mode of life should be regulated according to strict
hygienic principles. Fresh air, sunshine, baths, and
suitable exercise should be prescribed. Studious girls
should be made to lead more active lives. A change of
surroundings is beneficial. A visit to the seashore and
salt-water baths are of advantage.</p>

<p>The general health should be improved by the administration
of iron, strychnine, or some other tonic. Blaud’s
pill and the hypophosphites are useful. Obesity should
be relieved by a regulated diet and exercise. The regularity
of the bowels should always be carefully attended
to. Most of the so-called emmenagogues are of but little,
if any, value. Benefit is sometimes derived from the use
of potassium permanganate (gr. j-ij three times a day)
and the binoxide of manganese (gr. j-ij three times a
day). These medicines should be administered in pill
form for several weeks.</p>

<p>Oxalic acid in doses of from ⅒ to ¼ of a grain, given
in lemon syrup for a period of from one to four months,
has been recommended, and is sometimes very useful.</p>

<p>It seems probable that pelvic massage practised for a
period of several months may result in benefit.</p>

<p><b id="ACUTE_SUPPRESSION_OF_MENSTRUATION">Acute suppression of menstruation</b> during a menstrual
period is a phenomenon to which the term amenorrhea
is not properly applicable. It may be caused by
exposure to cold or by some sudden emotional disturbance
during the menstrual flow.</p>

<p>The condition may be unaccompanied by any subjective
symptoms, or there may be present ovarian and pelvic
pain.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> consists in rest in bed, the application
of warm fomentations to the lower abdomen, and hot
foot-baths. Especial care of the general health should
be observed at the following menstrual period.</p>

<p><b id="SCANTY_MENSTRUATION">Scanty Menstruation.</b>&mdash;Scanty menstruation occurs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
when the menstrual flow is much less than normal. It
must be remembered that individual peculiarities in this
respect may be within the limits of health. When one
or more periods are missed, and the flow shows a continual
tendency to diminish in amount, treatment may be
demanded.</p>

<p>The causes and the treatment of scanty menstruation
are those which have already been considered under
Amenorrhea.</p>

<p><b id="VICARIOUS_MENSTRUATION">Vicarious Menstruation.</b>&mdash;Vicarious menstruation is
the discharge of blood, at the menstrual periods, from
some part of the body other than the uterus. In some
cases, instead of a discharge of blood, a secretion of another
character takes place.</p>

<p>The vicarious discharge may be the only phenomenon
present, or it may occur supplementary to the normal
uterine bleeding.</p>

<p>The vicarious bleeding may take place from almost any
part of the mucous or cutaneous structures. It occurs
from the nose, the throat, the lungs, the stomach, the
bladder, and the anus. It may occur from an ulcer or
other lesion of the external surface. Sometimes the cutaneous
hemorrhages appear in the form of ecchymoses.</p>

<p>Various secretions may take the place of the bleeding.
A monthly flow of milk from the breasts has been observed,
and a periodical diarrhea or leucorrhea has taken
place.</p>

<p>Vicarious menstruation is a rare condition. It may
occur in defective development of the uterus and ovaries.
It is usually found in debilitated nervous women, and accompanies
a deficient menstrual discharge from the
uterus.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Direct local treatment should be applied
to the vicarious bleeding only when it becomes excessive.
The general health of the woman should receive attention.
Treatment should be applied to any local lesion of
the genital apparatus that may be discovered. The directions
given for amenorrhea are also applicable here.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<h3 id="THE_MENOPAUSE">THE MENOPAUSE.</h3>

<p>The menopause is the final cessation of menstruation.
The age at which it occurs is dependent upon a great
variety of conditions&mdash;nationality, climate, mode of life,
constitutional and local diseases. In the northern countries
of Europe the menopause is said to appear later than
in the southern; in England, later than in America. It
has been observed that country women menstruate to a
later age than city women. The woman who bears a
number of children in rapid succession and suckles them
not infrequently has a premature menopause. The menopause
may appear early in very fat women and in women
who are the victims of tuberculosis, nephritis, and diabetes.
Disease of the uterus, tubes, and ovaries may
retard the menopause. In fibroid tumor of the uterus the
menopause may be delayed for several years.</p>

<p>In this country the menopause occurs between the
fortieth and fiftieth years&mdash;usually about the age of
forty-five.</p>

<p>The menstrual bleeding may gradually diminish in
amount until it disappears; or it may stop abruptly and
permanently; or there may occur one or more intervals
of amenorrhea of one, two, or three months’ duration,
followed by normal menstrual bleedings, perhaps of
diminished amount, before the flow finally ceases.</p>

<p>Profuse bleeding at the time of the menopause and
slight bleeding occurring more often than monthly
are, unfortunately, viewed by most women as of no
moment, and as part of the normal phenomena of
the change through which they are passing. The same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
may be said of the apparent reappearance of menstruation,
or of slight irregular hemorrhages occurring after
the menopause had been established and menstruation had
been absent perhaps for many months. These phenomena
are not normal. They should always excite the
alarm of the woman, and they demand immediate examination
on the part of her physician. As a rule, the bleeding
is caused by some pathological condition of the uterus&mdash;fungous
growths, polypi, fibroids, or cancer. The
benign lesions may disappear spontaneously with the
progressing atrophy of the womb, and the hemorrhages
may cease. Many women undoubtedly recover without
treatment, and are thus confirmed in the belief that such
irregular hemorrhages are a normal part of the menopause;
and the unfortunate women with cancer are thus
encouraged to delay seeking medical advice until the disease
has progressed too far for cure.</p>

<p>The normal changes of the genital organs that begin
at the menopause are those of atrophy slowly progressing
to the senile condition. The ovaries atrophy; the epithelial
elements gradually give place to connective tissue;
the Graafian follicles and corpora lutea are destroyed; the
tunica albuginea becomes thick and shriveled. The
uterus diminishes in size; the vaginal cervix may disappear;
the utricular glands diminish in size and number;
the endometrium atrophies. The Fallopian tubes shrink
and become shortened, and the fimbriæ disappear. Similar
atrophic changes affect the vagina, the external genitals,
and the mammary glands.</p>

<p>If the woman is in good general health, and has no
disease of the uterus, the tubes, or the ovaries, the menopause
may become established without any marked general
disturbance.</p>

<p>In many cases, however, very annoying general symptoms
appear, and last for one or two years before the
woman becomes adapted to the altered conditions.</p>

<p>There may be headache, flushes of heat, nervous depression,
derangement of the digestive apparatus, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
other functional disturbance. The woman often becomes
very fat at this period. The nervous derangement may
be so severe as to result in insanity.</p>

<p>The vaso-motor disturbances are often the most annoying.
The phenomena of the “flushes” consist of a feeling
of heat over the whole or a part of the body, followed
by sweating and the sensation of cold or a slight chill.
The flushes may occur frequently during the day, sometimes
several times during an hour.</p>

<p>The treatment of the menopause should be directed to
the maintenance of the general bodily and mental health.
The diet should be carefully regulated. Too much
nutritious food should be forbidden. Purgatives should
be administered whenever necessary. The woman should
have plenty of fresh air and the proper amount of exercise.
Mental depression demands a change of locality
and surroundings.

<h3 id="GENITAL_FISTULÆ">GENITAL FISTULÆ.</h3>

<p>Fistulous openings may exist between the different
portions of the genital tract and the neighboring structures.
Such fistulæ are the result of childbirth, operative
or other form of traumatism, congenital defect, cancer,
syphilis, or suppuration. The accompanying diagram
(<a href="#fig_180">Fig. 180</a>) shows the chief varieties of fistula that occur.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_180" src="images/fig_180.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 180.-</span>-Diagram illustrating the chief varieties of genital fistula: <i>v. u.</i>,
vesico-uterine fistula; <i>v. v.</i>, vesico-vaginal fistula; <i>u. v.</i>, urethro-vaginal fistula;
<i>r. v.</i>, recto-vaginal fistula.</p></div>

<p><b id="VESICO_VAGINAL_FISTULA">Vesico-vaginal Fistula.</b>&mdash;The most frequent form of
fistulous opening occurs in the septum between the bladder
and the vagina. The condition is usually caused by
sloughing, the result of prolonged pressure from the fetal
head at labor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span></p>

<p>In some cases such an opening is made for therapeutic
reasons by the physician, for the cure of cystitis.</p>

<p>Intelligent midwifery and the prompt and proper use
of the obstetrical forceps have greatly diminished the
frequency of vesico-vaginal fistula. It was formerly a
very common disease. At the present day it is but rarely
seen, at least in those parts of the country where women
have competent attendance at labor.</p>

<p>The vesico-vaginal opening may be situated at any
portion of the septum. It varies very much in size and
shape. It may be a small hole barely admitting a fine
probe-point, a median slit, or a large irregular opening
involving the whole base of the bladder.</p>

<p>The appearance of the fistula varies according to the
time that has elapsed since the receipt of the injury.
The margins of the opening, which are at first irregular
and ulcerated, become in time thin and firm from cicatricial
contraction, and the size of the opening becomes
similarly diminished.</p>

<p>The first symptom of vesico-vaginal fistula is the involuntary
escape of urine from the vagina. If the condition
has resulted from pressure at parturition, the incontinence
of urine does not appear for five or ten days
after labor, when the slough has separated. When a
direct laceration of the vesico-vaginal septum has occurred,
the urine will escape immediately.</p>

<p>The degree of incontinence varies with the size and
the position of the fistula. If the opening is small and
is situated in the upper part of the vagina, there may be
perfect continence when the woman is in the erect position,
as long as the urine remains below the level of the
opening. Incontinence returns when the accumulation
of urine becomes greater than this and when the woman
assumes the recumbent posture. I have seen a woman
with a fistula of this kind who was only troubled with
incontinence at night.</p>

<p>The secondary symptoms of vesico-vaginal fistula are
due to the irritation of the urine. Unless the greatest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
cleanliness be observed, great suffering may result within
a few weeks after the receipt of the injury. The vagina,
the labia, and the inner aspects of the thighs become inflamed
and excoriated. The mucous membrane of the
vagina may become covered with an offensive phosphatic
deposit. If the fistulous opening be large, the fundus of
the bladder may prolapse into the vagina and become
covered with a similar deposit.</p>

<p>Secondary kidney disease, from infection of the ureters,
may follow in time.</p>

<p>As the result of disuse the bladder becomes contracted,
and its walls become thickened from inflammatory infiltration,
so that when the fistula is closed the capacity of
the bladder is much less than normal. Disuse of the
urethra results also in contraction, which may be so extensive
as seriously to complicate treatment.</p>

<p>Physical examination usually reveals the condition.
The woman should be placed in the Sims, the genu-pectoral,
or the lithotomy position, and the anterior vaginal
wall should be examined through the Sims speculum.
The examiner should, of course, determine that the involuntary
flow of urine comes from the vagina, and not
from the urethra. Women are often unable to tell accurately
whence the urine escapes, and the single symptom
of incontinence of urine is not pathognomonic of
fistula.</p>

<p>In most cases the fistulous opening may be readily
detected, and a sound passed through the urethra may be
made to emerge in the vagina. In the case of small
openings, however, obscurely situated in the upper part
of the vagina, and especially in case of vesico-uterine
fistula, it may be difficult to demonstrate the presence of
a fistula. In such cases the bladder may be filled with
sterile milk, which may then be seen escaping into the
vagina. This is a valuable method of diagnosis in the
rare cases of uretero-vaginal fistula.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The method of curing vesico-vaginal fistula
was taught to the world by Marion Sims, who operated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
successfully in 1849, and who published his first
article upon the subject in 1852.</p>

<p>Careful preparatory treatment before operation is usually
necessary. Unless the vagina and the bladder are in
a healthy condition beforehand, every method of operation
is likely to fail.</p>

<p>It is necessary to treat all excoriations or ulcerations,
to cure the cystitis, and to relieve the tension of all bands
of scar-tissue in the vagina that may prevent proper approximation
of the edges of the opening.</p>

<p>The phosphatic deposit should be carefully removed
from the vaginal walls and the interior of the bladder
with a soft sponge or cotton, and a weak solution of
nitrate of silver (gr. v to ℥j) should be applied to the raw
surfaces.</p>

<p>Frequent warm sitz-baths should be administered daily.
The vagina should be washed out several times a day
with large quantities of sterile hot water or with a solution
of boracic acid (ʒj to the pint).</p>

<p>The urine, which is generally alkaline, should be rendered
acid by the use of benzoic or boracic acid.</p>

<p>Emmet advises the following prescription: “2 drams
of benzoic acid and 3 drams of borax to 12 ounces of
water, of which a tablespoonful, further diluted, should be
given three or four times a day.” After the urine has
become acid the dose may be reduced.</p>

<p>Every fifth day the solution of nitrate of silver should
be applied to the unhealed, excoriated surfaces. It may
be necessary to pursue this treatment several weeks before
the parts are brought to a healthy condition. Improvement
is perceived not only in the condition of
the vaginal walls and the bladder, but in the edges of
the fistula, which, in place of being hypertrophied and
indurated, assume a natural color and density.</p>

<p>In case the vaginal fistula be small, the accompanying
cystitis may be difficult to cure, because there is always
some residual urine in the bladder. It may then be advisable,
as a preparatory step, to enlarge the fistulous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
opening by a clean incision in the median line, in order
to secure more perfect drainage. The cystitis may be
kept up by the presence of a phosphatic concretion in the
bladder, which may be removed in this way. It is useless
to close the fistula until the cystitis is cured.</p>

<p>In every case of vesico-vaginal fistula it is advisable
to examine for vesical calculus, that the bladder may not
be closed with a calculus in it. The calculus occasionally
exists before the formation of the fistula, and perhaps assists
in its production, the vesico-vaginal septum being
squeezed between the child’s head and the calculus. Usually,
however, the calculus forms as a result of the fistula.</p>

<p>When the parts have been brought to a healthy condition
the fistula should be examined with a view to the
method of closure. The opening should be exposed with
the Sims speculum, and the edges at opposite points
should be seized with tenacula or forceps and approximated.
In this way the surgeon may determine the direction
in which the fistula may be closed with the least
traction on the sutures. When possible, it is advisable,
in order to prevent shortening of the vagina, to close the
fistula in the direction of the long axis of the vagina.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_181" src="images/fig_181.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 181.</span>&mdash;Sims’ vaginal dilator.</p></div>

<p>If the edges of the opening cannot readily be brought
together, any restraining bands of tissue in the vaginal
walls should be divided with scissors. If these bands are
slight and superficial, they may be divided at the time of
operation for closure. If, however, they are extensive,
preparatory treatment devoted to the liberation of the
edges of the fistula must be practised. All restraining
bands should be freely divided, and after the vagina has
thus been opened up, it
should be distended (to
prevent subsequent contraction)
by introducing a
vaginal plug or dilator
(<a href="#fig_181">Fig. 181</a>) or a rubber bag
packed with sponges.
Bleeding is generally controlled by the pressure of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
plug. The vaginal plugs of glass or of hard rubber are
made of various sizes. They should be long enough and
thick enough to stretch the vagina without producing
sloughing. The plug is retained by a <span class="sans">T</span>-bandage.</p>

<p>After this operation the woman should be kept in bed
for a week or ten days. The urine should be drawn with
the catheter without removing the plug. When suppuration
begins the plug will become loosened and may be
removed. Emmet says: “It is remarkable how much
absorption of the cicatricial tissue takes place in a few
weeks when judicious pressure has been maintained by
this instrument.”</p>

<p>After removing the plug, vaginal douches should be
resumed until healing is complete.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this consideration that the preparatory
treatment may be severe and may extend over a long
period. Such extensive treatment is not by any means
always necessary; when, however, it is required, it is useless
to proceed to operation without it.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i>&mdash;The operation consists in freshening the
edges of the fistula with the knife or scissors and bringing
them into apposition with the interrupted suture.
Different forms of suture have been used by various operators.
If the parts are in a healthy condition and are
properly denuded and approximated, it makes no difference
in the result what form of suture is used. As in all
forms of plastic work, I prefer silkworm gut shotted.
The operation is most easily performed with the woman
in the Sims position, the vagina being exposed with the
Sims speculum. The lithotomy or the genu-pectoral
position is preferred by some operators. The edge of the
opening should be seized with the tenaculum or with
tissue-forceps, and a continuous strip of tissue should be
removed all around the fistula, extending from the mucous
membrane of the bladder out upon the vaginal surface
for a quarter or three-eighths of an inch. The vaginal
mucous membrane usually retracts somewhat as soon
as it is liberated from the fistulous margin, so that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
raw surface is broader than the strip removed. It is advisable
to avoid any injury to the mucous membrane of
the bladder, as free bleeding may take place from this
structure. The denuded surface should extend as near as
possible to the mucous membrane of the bladder without
involving it.</p>

<p>The denudation should be extended some distance beyond
each angle of the fistula, in order to secure perfect
apposition in these positions.</p>

<p>The length and shape of the needle used for closing
the opening varies with the fancy of the
operator. As a rule, a small needle,
straight or curved at the point, is most
convenient (<a href="#fig_182">Fig. 182</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_182" src="images/fig_182.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 182.</span>&mdash;Fistula-needles.</p></div>

<p>The needle should be introduced about
an eighth of an inch from the edge of
the vaginal mucous membrane, and
should be made to emerge at the edge of
the mucous membrane of the bladder.
It should be reintroduced and emerge in the reverse order
on the opposite side (<a href="#fig_183">Fig. 183</a>). The sutures should be
placed about a quarter of an inch apart.</p>

<p>After the sutures have been introduced, and before
they have been shotted or tied, the bladder should be
thoroughly washed out with a warm boric-acid solution.
The operator should make sure that no blood-clot is left
in the bladder. After the sutures have been shotted a
light gauze tampon may be placed in the vagina.
A permanent soft-rubber catheter may be introduced
through the urethra, or the urine may be drawn every
three or four hours after the operation. If care is given
to the cleanliness of the catheter, it is perhaps best to
retain it in the bladder for three or four days, after which
the urine may be drawn every four hours. The catheter
should be removed twice in twenty-four hours for purposes
of cleansing. The eye of the catheter frequently
becomes obstructed by blood-clot.</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten that the bladder is often
much contracted in old cases of vesico-vaginal fistula,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
and as the capacity is diminished more frequent catheterization
than usual is necessary.</p>

<p>Boric or benzoic acid should be continued during the
convalescence.</p>

<p>The gauze tampon should be removed on the second day.</p>

<p>The bowels should be moved on the second or third
day. The sutures may remain for two weeks. The
woman may sit up at the end of two weeks.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_183" src="images/fig_183.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 183.</span>&mdash;Vesico-vaginal fistula with the sutures introduced.</p></div>

<p>The operation described here&mdash;more or less modified
in order to meet the requirements of different cases&mdash;will
result in cure in the great majority of instances.
Often much depends upon the ingenuity and the mechanical
skill of the operator. Sometimes two or three
operations are necessary before the opening can be completely
closed, the operator closing part at each sitting.</p>

<p>In the case of a small fistulous opening it may be
necessary to enlarge it by free incision before the denudation
and the introduction of the sutures can be properly
accomplished.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span></p>

<p>In the very rare cases which are incurable by operation
<i>kolpokleisis</i>, or closure of the vagina, has been practised
by some. The operation was performed by removing a
circular strip around the circumference of the vagina,
immediately above the ostium vaginæ, and approximating
the raw surfaces by a transverse row of sutures.
This operation makes of the bladder and the vagina one
urinary pouch into which menstrual blood and uterine discharges
flow. It should never be practised. I quote from
Emmet in this connection: “From my own observation
I have learned that it is but a question of a few months,
a year, or possibly two years, before serious consequences
must arise after leaving a receptacle, like a portion of the
vagina, in which the urine may stagnate. To give a
retentive power for so short a time is not a sufficient
compensation for the suffering and consequences that
supervene. As the result of my experience, I would
urge that the operation never be resorted to under any
circumstances. The maximum has now been reduced to
2 or 3 per cent. of cases where the resources of the surgeon
cannot overcome all the difficulties that may be
presented in closing a vesico-vaginal fistula.”</p>

<p>The forms of operation in which the cervix uteri is
utilized to assist in the closure of a vesical fistula, as a
result of which the menstrual blood and the uterine
secretions are discharged into the bladder, are contraindicated
for similar reasons.</p>

<p><b id="URETHRO_VAGINAL_FISTULA">Urethro-vaginal fistula</b> is much less common than
vesical fistula. Unless the neck of the bladder be involved,
there may be perfect control of urine; though,
of course, when the urine is voided it will escape from
the ostium vaginæ, and not from the external meatus.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> of urethro-vaginal fistula is essentially
the same as that already described for vesico-vaginal
fistula. The edges should be denuded, and the opening
into the urethra closed over a large-sized catheter. The
line of union should be in the long axis of the urethra.</p>

<p><b id="VESICO_UTERINE_FISTULA">Vesico-uterine Fistula.</b>&mdash;In this form of fistula the
opening usually extends from the bladder into the cervical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
canal. It is caused by labor in which the anterior
lip of the cervix is lacerated. The lower portion of the
cervical laceration may unite, leaving the fistulous opening
above.</p>

<p>The <i>diagnosis</i> of the condition is made from observing
urine escape from the cervical canal, or by injecting the
bladder with milk or other colored fluid. A sound introduced
in the cervix may be brought in contact with a probe
passed through the urethra and bladder into the fistula.</p>

<p>If these methods of examination are not satisfactory,
endoscopic examination of the interior of the bladder
will reveal the abnormal opening.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> consists in dividing the anterior lip of
the cervix and the vaginal wall down to the fistulous
tract; thorough denudation of the walls of the fistula;
and closure of the whole incision by interrupted sutures.</p>

<p><b id="URETERO_VAGINAL_FISTULA">Uretero-vaginal Fistula.</b>&mdash;This condition is usually
the result of injury to the ureter by operation. It may
occur from the destruction of tissue caused by pelvic
abscess, which discharges through the vaginal vault. In
extensive vesico-vaginal fistula caused by sloughing after
labor the bladder-wall may become rolled out so that the
ureter opens into the vagina.</p>

<p>If but one ureter is involved, one-half of the urine
will be discharged in the natural way and the other half
by the vagina.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> consists in directing the ureter into the
bladder by plastic operation performed through the vagina;
or by performing celiotomy, dissecting out the
ureter, and implanting it in the fundus of the bladder.</p>

<p><b id="RECTO_VAGINAL_FISTULA">Recto-vaginal Fistula.</b>&mdash;Recto-vaginal fistula is usually
caused by parturition. The destruction of tissue is
sometimes due to syphilis. In the latter case cure is difficult,
and sometimes impossible.</p>

<p>The <i>symptom</i> of the condition is the passage of feces
and flatus into the vagina.</p>

<p>Sometimes but a very small opening exists, situated immediately
above the sphincter muscle; in other cases the
greater portion of the recto-vaginal septum is destroyed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span></p>

<p>The condition may be recognized by placing the woman
in the lithotomy position and exposing the posterior vaginal
wall by the Sims speculum placed under the pubic
arch.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> consists in operation similar to that described
under the consideration of vesico-vaginal fistula.
The woman should be prepared as for a plastic operation
upon the perineum. The rectum should be thoroughly
emptied before operating. The sphincter ani should be
stretched. It is always advisable, when possible, to close
the opening from the vagina.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane of the rectum should be injured
as little as possible, in order to limit the bleeding.
It may be necessary to relieve tension on the edges of the
fistula by making, on each side of the vaginal aspect of
the opening, an incision parallel to the long axis of the
vagina.</p>

<p>In case of a small fistula situated immediately above
the sphincter ani, it is sometimes difficult to denude and
to introduce the sutures. It then becomes necessary to
divide the perineum and the sphincter ani to the fistula,
denude the edges, and to introduce sutures as in a case
of complete median laceration of the perineum. Sometimes
the recto-vaginal fistula is much larger on the vaginal
than on the rectal aspect&mdash;is, in fact, funnel-shaped,
the destruction of tissue having been greater upon the
vaginal surface. If in such a case the edges of the fistula
cannot be brought into apposition after freeing all restraining
bands, it may be necessary to split the edge of
the opening, so that the rectal wall is freed and may be
brought together by sutures introduced through the rectum,
leaving the vaginal opening to be filled by granulation.
The rectal sutures may be introduced by placing
the woman in the Sims position and exposing the anterior
rectal wall with the Sims speculum.</p>

<p>The after-treatment resembles in all respects that prescribed
after operation for laceration through the sphincter
ani. The sutures should be removed in two weeks.

<h3 id="DISEASES_OF_THE_URETHRA_AND_BLADDER">DISEASES OF THE URETHRA AND BLADDER.</h3>

<p>Before considering in detail the diseases of the urethra
and bladder, it will be necessary to describe the
modern methods of examining these structures.</p>

<p>The examination of the urethra and bladder has been
very much facilitated by the methods and instruments
that have been popularized in this country by Kelly.
The following apparatus is required: a female catheter;
a urethral calibrator; a series of specula with obturators;
a head-mirror and light or an electric headlight; long,
delicate toothed forceps (<a href="#fig_184">Fig. 184</a>); an inclined plane or
several hard pillows for elevating the pelvis; small balls
of absorbent cotton about the size of a pea, or strips of
absorbent gauze cut 1 inch in width and about 10 inches
long, for drying out the bladder.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_184" src="images/fig_184.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 184.</span>&mdash;Mouse-tooth forceps for bladder.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_185" src="images/fig_185.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 185.</span>&mdash;Urethral dilator: short lines indicate diameter in millimeters.</p></div>

<p>The urethral calibrator or dilator (<a href="#fig_185">Fig. 185</a>) is a conical
metal instrument with a maximum diameter of twenty
millimeters. The diameters in millimeters of the various
portions are indicated by numbers upon the instrument.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span></p>

<p>The urethral calibrator is useful for dilating the external
meatus to a degree sufficient to admit the necessary
speculum. The external meatus is, as a rule, the only
portion of the urethra that requires dilatation. Any instrument
that will pass through the meatus will pass
through the rest of the canal.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_186" src="images/fig_186.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 186.</span>&mdash;Kelly’s cystoscope or vesical speculum.</p></div>

<p>The speculum (<a href="#fig_186">Fig. 186</a>) is a cylindrical metal tube
fitted with a handle on which is the number indicating
the size of the instrument. There are a number of specula,
varying in diameter from 5 to 20 millimeters. Each
speculum is fitted with an obturator. The most useful
specula are those ranging from 8 to 12 millimeters in diameter.
The urethra may readily be dilated up to 12 millimeters,
with little if any, external laceration. Dilatation
sufficient to admit the largest instrument (20 millimeters)
is always accompanied by considerable laceration of the
urethral opening. Dilatation of the urethra should never
be practised beyond this degree, on account of the danger
of subsequent incontinence of urine.</p>

<p>An anesthetic is usually required for the examination,
unless the woman be capable of enduring considerable
pain, or has become accustomed to the procedure from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
previous experience. Local anesthesia of the urethra
with cocaine (gr. x to ℥j) is often sufficient.</p>

<p>The woman is placed on the table in the lithotomy
position, and the bladder is emptied with the catheter.
The external meatus is then dilated to the requisite size
by inserting the graduated calibrator with a general rotary
movement. When the meatus has been stretched
sufficiently, as indicated by the number on the calibrator
(usually about 12 millimeters), the instrument is withdrawn,
and the speculum of corresponding number, armed
with the obturator, is introduced; the obturator is then
removed.</p>

<p>The hips of the woman are now elevated on the pillows
or the inclined plane, or the foot of the table is raised, so
that the hips shall be from 10 to 20 inches above the level
of the shoulders.</p>

<p>The examiner, armed with the head-mirror or light, is
then prepared to inspect the interior of the bladder. If
the mirror is used, the light (Argand burner or electric
drop-light) should be held close to the pubis of the patient.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_187" src="images/fig_187.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 187.</span>&mdash;Vesical probe or applicator.</p></div>

<p>Usually a small quantity of urine remains in the
bladder after catheterization, or is secreted during the
preliminary procedures, and it is necessary to remove
this before complete examination of the bladder can be
made. This may be done by means of the small balls of
absorbent cotton or the strips of gauze grasped with the
long-toothed forceps and passed in through the speculum;
or some form of suction apparatus may be employed,
consisting of a rubber exhaust bulb and a long metal
tube perforated at the distal end by small openings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span></p>

<p>The elevated position of the hips is an essential part
of this method of examination; it permits the intestines
to gravitate out of the pelvis, and, as soon as the urethra
is opened, the bladder becomes distended with air, so that
all of its interior may be readily inspected, and applications
to the surface may be directly made through the
speculum. In some cases it is difficult to produce the
requisite distention of the bladder by elevating the hips.
This difficulty may arise in the case of very fat women.
It then becomes necessary to place the patient in the
knee-chest position, when the requisite distention is
readily accomplished.</p>

<p>As the speculum is withdrawn from the bladder the internal
meatus and the urethral walls may be examined as
they fall together beyond the distal end of the instrument.</p>

<h4 id="DISEASES_OF_THE_URETHRA">DISEASES OF THE URETHRA.</h4>

<p>The female urethra is a musculo-membranous canal
averaging 1¾ inches in length, and, when not stretched,
about ¼ inch in diameter. The urethra is normally closed
by the apposition of its walls. In the neighborhood of
the external meatus it is an antero-posterior slit. In the
neighborhood of the internal meatus it is a transverse
slit. In the middle portion the mucous membrane is
arranged in longitudinal folds, and a transverse section
shows a stellate closure.</p>

<p>The muscular coat of the urethra contains both striped
and unstriped muscular fibers.</p>

<p>The mucous glands of the urethra are most numerous
in the region of the external meatus. Skene first described
two glands that are worthy of special mention.
<i>Skene’s glands</i> are two tubules, large enough to admit a
No. 1 probe of the French scale, that lie upon the floor
of the urethra immediately within the external meatus.
They lie parallel to the long axis of the urethra, and in
length vary from ⅜ to ¾ of an inch. They are placed
beneath the mucous membrane, in the muscular coat.
The orifices of the glands are on the free surface of the
mucosa, immediately within the external meatus. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
young women the orifices are found about ⅛ of an inch
above the plane of the external meatus. If the external
meatus be patulous, or if there be any prolapse or inflammation
of the mucous membrane of the urethra, the orifices
of Skene’s glands may be seen upon each side of
the urethral orifice as soon as the labia are separated.
In gonorrhea their position is often indicated by a small
drop of pus exuding from the orifices. The upper ends
of the glands may terminate in a number of divisions.</p>

<p><b id="URETHRITIS">Urethritis.</b>&mdash;Urethritis is much less frequent in women
than in men. In the great majority of cases it is caused
by gonorrhea. Aside from microscopic examination, urethritis,
acute or chronic, may be considered one of the
strongest evidences of gonorrheal infection that we have.</p>

<p>Urethritis is also rarely caused by the exanthematous
diseases, irritation of concentrated urine, vaginal discharges,
chemical irritants, and traumatism.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;The symptoms of urethritis in the acute
stage of the disease are frequent and painful urination.
Burning and scalding sensations are experienced along
the course of the urethra during urination. Occasionally
a few drops of blood escape during or after urination.
As the disease progresses toward cure or passes
into the chronic stage, the intensity of these symptoms
diminishes, and finally they disappear.</p>

<p>Examination of the parts shows that the external
meatus is red and swollen. The swollen mucous membrane
may bulge through the opening, giving the appearance
of prolapse. The orifices of Skene’s glands may
be conspicuous. If the woman have not recently urinated,
a drop of pus may appear at the meatus, or it may
be brought into view by vaginal pressure along the course
of the urethra. Pressure upon the urethra through the
vagina causes pain. This is one of the best tests of inflammation
of this structure. The urethra may feel
hypertrophied, indurated, or cord-like to the touch. The
urethral discharge should always be examined microscopically
for the gonococci.</p>

<p>In chronic urethritis the subjective symptoms are usually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
absent&mdash;except, perhaps, frequency of urination.
The diagnosis is made by physical examination. If the
woman has not urinated for several hours, the examiner
will be able to express, by vaginal pressure along the
course of the urethra, a drop of muco-purulent fluid resembling
the gleety discharge of the male.</p>

<p>The endoscope reveals the presence of congestion and
inflammation of the mucous membrane.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;In the acute or the painful stage of the
disease no local applications should be made. The external
genitals should be bathed several times a day with
hot water, preferably by means of sitz-baths. Vaginal
douches are not indicated unless the vagina be involved
in the inflammation. The vaginal syringe may be the
means of carrying infection higher up in the genital
tract. Rest in the recumbent position, if possible, is
desirable. The diet should be non-stimulating, and
large quantities of diluent drinks, such as flaxseed tea,
should be prescribed. The bowels should be kept loose
by saline purgatives.</p>

<p>In the subacute or the chronic stages of the disease
boracic acid (gr. x-xx three or four times a day), salol,
oil of sandal-wood, cubebs, copaiba, and other drugs
used for the similar condition in the male are indicated.
After painful micturition has ceased, the physician may
make local applications to the urethra, in case the inflammation
does not subside satisfactorily without them.
Such local applications are not always necessary, and
they may do harm unless proper care is exercised in their
administration. Asepsis and gentleness are necessary, and
the applications should never be too strong or irritating.</p>

<p>Frequent douching of the urethra (two or three times
a day if possible) with sterile hot water is often of much
benefit. Skene’s reflux catheter should be used (<a href="#fig_188">Fig.
188</a>). The shaft of this instrument is fluted or grooved
to permit the return of the fluid. The catheter should
be introduced as far as the internal meatus; a fountain
syringe should be attached to it, and the urethra should
be washed out with a quart of hot water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span></p>

<p>After the irrigation the catheter should be withdrawn
and a urethral injection of nitrate of silver (gr. j or ij to
℥j) should be administered. The injection may be given
by means of a glass pipette the nozzle of which is large
enough to encircle the external meatus. The nozzle
should be placed over, not in, the meatus. The female
urethra will hold about 15 minims of fluid; more than
this should not be injected. As the condition improves
the frequency of these treatments may be diminished.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_188" src="images/fig_188.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 188.</span>&mdash;Skene’s reflux catheter.</p></div>

<p>If the condition does not yield to such treatment within
a few weeks, application should be made directly to the
mucous membrane of the urethra through the endoscope.
The urethral canal should be washed out as just
described, and the endoscope should be introduced as far
as the internal meatus. As it is slowly withdrawn the
application should be made over the whole inner surface
of the urethra by a fine applicator wrapped with cotton.
Nitrate of silver (gr. v-x to ℥j) should be employed.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is found that the suppuration persists in
Skene’s glands. A small drop of pus may be found
exuding from the orifice of the gland after the rest of the
urethra has been restored to a healthy condition. In such
a case the gland should be split up on the urethral surface
by introducing into it one blade of a fine scissors,
and the tract should be carefully wiped out with pure
carbolic acid or a strong solution of nitrate of silver.</p>

<p>In every case of urethritis of gonorrheal origin it is of
the greatest importance that every trace of the disease
should be eradicated before the patient gives up treatment.
There is always danger of infection extending to
the upper parts of the genital tract.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span></p>

<p><b id="STRICTURE_OF_THE_URETHRA">Stricture of the Urethra.</b>&mdash;Stricture of the urethra
in the woman, unlike the similar condition in the male,
is very rare. It is caused by gonorrhea, injury at childbirth
or other traumatism, and caustic applications. The
stricture may exist at any part of the urethral canal.
The form most usually seen is that which occurs at the
external meatus, and is caused by the removal of abnormal
growths with caustic or with the knife.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i> of urethral stricture in women are much
less marked than those in men. There is frequent and
difficult urination. Occasionally there is incontinence or
partial retention of urine.</p>

<p>If the stricture exist at the external meatus, it may be
readily seen and its dimensions determined. If it exist
in the upper portion of the urethral canal, it may sometimes
be felt by palpation along the course of the urethra
through the vagina, the position of the stricture being
indicated by local thickening and induration. Its location
may also be determined, as in man, by the use of the
bulbous bougie or sound.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;When the stricture is situated at the external
meatus, it may be divided with the knife or forcibly
stretched. When it is situated in the upper portion
of the urethra, it is best treated by forcible dilatation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_189" src="images/fig_189.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 189.</span>&mdash;Female urethral sound.</p></div>

<p>The small uterine dilator is the most convenient instrument
to use. The dilatation should not extend beyond
half an inch, for fear of injuring the urethral walls
or producing incontinence. In order to prevent contraction,
it is advisable to pass the large urethral sound (10
millimeters) at intervals of one or two days after this operation,
until the patency of the urethra is ensured.</p>

<p>In some cases the continual subsequent use of the sound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
is necessary, as in stricture in the male. The woman
may be readily taught the use of the instrument herself.</p>

<p><b id="PROLAPSE_OF_THE_MUCOUS_MEMBRANE_OF_THE_URETHRA">Prolapse of the Mucous Membrane of the Urethra.</b>&mdash;Prolapse
of the urethral mucous membrane is of
unusual occurrence. Prolapse may be limited to part of
the circumference of the meatus, or it may extend around
the whole canal. The condition is usually found in weak,
debilitated women. It may occur during childhood.</p>

<p>The prolapse may be caused by dilatation of the urethra
and the external meatus or by the traction of a neoplasm
of the urethra. It sometimes occurs after labor.
It may be produced by continual vesical tenesmus, the
result of cystitis, calculus, or a tumor of the bladder.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i>, vesical tenesmus and dysuria, are usually
present. Sometimes incontinence of urine occurs.
The protruding mucous membrane may become irritated
and inflamed, and cause much local pain. It has been
known to slough off.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The treatment should be directed, in the
first place, to the relief of any causative condition, such
as cystitis or calculus.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the protruding mucous membrane
should be relieved by local applications of hot water and
by rest in bed. The mucous membrane should then be
gently replaced within the urethra, and contraction of
the canal should be promoted by the use of astringent
injections of tannic acid or alum.</p>

<p>If the disease does not yield to this treatment, the prolapsed
mucous membrane should be excised, and the edges
of the mucosa should be stitched to the margin of the
meatus by fine suture.</p>

<p>After this operation there is sometimes cicatricial contraction
of the external meatus, which may readily be
cured by forcible dilatation.</p>

<p><b id="VESICO_URETHRAL_FISSURE">Vesico-urethral Fissure.</b>&mdash;Vesico-urethral fissure is
an ulcerated crack of the mucous membrane situated at
the internal urinary meatus. The upper portion extends
into the bladder, the lower portion is in the urethra.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
Skene describes it as “from ¼ to ⅜ of an inch in
length, and from 1/12 to ⅙ of an inch in width at the center,
but tapering off at each end. The deepest part has
a yellowish-gray color, like that of an indolent ulcer,
while the edges are red and actually inflamed, like those
of an irritable ulcer.”</p>

<p>Vesico-urethral fissure is usually caused by urethritis.
It may also result from injuries during confinement or
from the bungling use of the catheter.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;There is a constant desire to urinate, and
urination is followed by severe tenesmus. There is a
burning pain at the neck of the bladder, increased immediately
after urination. Pressure upon the internal
meatus through the vagina may cause lancinating pain.</p>

<p>The symptoms resemble closely those of urethritis and
cystitis.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_190" src="images/fig_190.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 190.</span>&mdash;Skene’s urethral endoscope.</p></div>

<p>The <i>diagnosis</i> of vesico-urethral fissure can be made
with certainty only by seeing the fissure through the
endoscope. The existence of the condition may be suspected
in a woman who presents the symptoms just described,
and in whom no signs of inflammation or other
disease of the urethra or the bladder can be detected.</p>

<p>The open endoscope is not satisfactory for detecting
this condition, because the fissure is hidden from view by
the folds of mucous membrane at the upper end of the
instrument. Skene, who has especially directed attention
to vesico-urethral fissure, states that he never was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
able to detect the lesion until he used the form of endoscope
introduced by him (<a href="#fig_190">Fig. 190</a>), which consists of a
small glass tube like the ordinary test-tube, into which
is passed a mirror on a holder. The instrument is passed
into the urethra, and light is thrown in by means of the
concave head-mirror. By moving the small mirror in
the tube, different parts of the urethral walls may be examined.
The instrument opens out the folds of mucous
membrane immediately above the fissure and renders it
visible.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The cure of vesico-urethral fissure is often
difficult. The lesion is exposed to continuous irritation
from the urine and from the sphincteric action of the
muscular fibers at the vesical neck&mdash;an action which is
much increased by the tenesmus present. This constant
muscular action impedes healing, as in the case of fissure
of the anus. The internal urinary meatus should be
dilated under anesthesia to the extent of ½ inch by
means of the graduated bougies or the uterine dilator.
After dilatation the woman should be kept in bed and
the urine should be rendered as unirritating as possible by
the use of diluent drinks and boracic acid.</p>

<p>If this treatment does not result in cure, a vesico-vaginal
fistula should be made, so that, by carrying off
the urine by this means, rest from functional activity will
be furnished to the region of the vesical neck.</p>

<p>No effort need be made to keep the fistula open, as by
the time it has closed spontaneously the fissure will have
healed.</p>

<p><b id="DILATATION_OF_URETHRA">Dilatation of the Urethra.</b>&mdash;Dilatation of the urethra
producing symptoms that require treatment is unusual.
It may be due to congenital defect, to spontaneous expulsion,
or instrumental extraction of a calculus or tumor
of the bladder, to excessive dilatation by the surgeon;
and it may occasionally follow pregnancy. Skene says,
“the hyperemia of the urethra which occurs in pregnancy
and which tends to produce overdistention of the
veins favors dilatation of the whole urethra.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span></p>

<p>The urethra may be so dilatable that it will admit the
penis&mdash;coitus having been practised in this way in a number
of instances.</p>

<p>In dilatation of the urethra there may be continuous
incontinence of urine, or the urine may escape only during
acts of straining, coughing, or lifting.</p>

<p>The condition may be determined by the insertion of
sounds or the finger.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i> should be directed to the cure of any
inflamed condition of the urethra which may accompany
dilatation, and to the use of astringent injections of tannic
acid.</p>

<p>If incontinence of urine persists it may be necessary to
perform a plastic operation, excising a portion of the
anterior wall of the vagina and the posterior wall of the
urethra, and closing the wound by transverse sutures.</p>

<p>In <i id="URETHROCELE">urethrocele</i> the dilatation is confined to a portion of
the urethra, usually the middle third. There is a sacculated
condition of the posterior wall of the urethra extending
into the vagina. The usual cause of this condition
is traumatism during labor. The symptoms are painful
and difficult micturition and partial incontinence of urine.
The condition may be diagnosed by the use of the sound
or the probe, which may be inserted in the sac through
the urethra, when the point may be felt by a finger on the
anterior vaginal wall. Sometimes the urethrocele produces
a distinct bulging in the anterior wall of the vagina.</p>

<p>If the annoying symptoms of urethrocele continue
after any accompanying inflammation of the urethra has
been relieved, it may be necessary to excise the sacculated
portion of the urethra by incision through the vaginal
wall and close the wound by suture.</p>

<h4 id="URETHRAL_NEOPLASMS">URETHRAL NEOPLASMS.</h4>

<p id="URETHRAL_CARUNCLE"><b>Urethral Caruncle.</b>&mdash;The urethral caruncle is a small
raspberry-like tumor situated at or just inside of the external
meatus. It is composed of dilated capillaries set in
a dense stroma of connective tissue and covered with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
mucous membrane. The tumor varies in size from a
pin-head to a hickory-nut. In color it varies from a pale
to a bright red. It is usually situated upon the posterior
wall of the urethra. There may be two or more such·
tumors around the circumference of the meatus, and occasionally
they are found in the vestibule. The growth
is usually sessile.</p>

<p>The caruncle is often erectile in character, and increases
in size at the menstrual period.</p>

<p>The growths bleed very easily on manipulation, and
are exquisitely sensitive. The urethral caruncle is the
commonest neoplasm of the urethra.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;The most marked symptom of urethral
caruncle is pain. Intense pain is experienced at micturition
and upon contact with the clothing or other body.
Sexual connection is sometimes rendered impossible.</p>

<p>There is usually more or less hemorrhage from the
tumor, which may rarely be so profuse as to cause marked
anemia. The general health suffers, and nervous symptoms,
resulting from the pain and loss of sleep, are often
present to a pronounced degree.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The treatment consists in the total extirpation
of the growth. It should be picked up with
forceps and excised with the knife or scissors. The edges
of the mucous membrane should be united by sutures.</p>

<p>Excision should be complete or the tumor may return.
In case of recurrence a second operation should be performed.</p>

<p><b id="URETHRAL_CYSTS">Urethral Cysts.</b>&mdash;Small cysts are occasionally found
in the course of the urethra. They may occur at any
point from the internal to the external meatus. They
are caused by obstruction and distention of the urethral
glands. They produce no symptoms unless large enough
to cause obstruction to the flow of urine. They may be
seen by the endoscope or may be palpated through the
vaginal wall.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> consists of incision and removal of part
of the cyst-wall.</p>

<p><b id="POLYPUS">Polypus.</b>&mdash;Mucous polyp of the urethra is of very rare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
occurrence. The tumor generally has a delicate pedicle,
and may protrude from the meatus. It is painless,
and causes discomfort only by obstructing the flow of
urine.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> consists of removal by torsion, ligature,
or excision.</p>

<p><b id="SARCOMA_AND_CANCER_OF_THE_URETHRA">Sarcoma</b> and <b>cancer</b> of the urethra have rarely been
observed. The phenomena are those similar to cancer in
other parts of the body.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> consists in thorough removal.</p>

<h4 id="DISEASES_OF_THE_BLADDER">DISEASES OF THE BLADDER.</h4>

<p>The urinary bladder has three coats&mdash;an outer incomplete
peritoneal investment, a middle muscular coat, and
an inner lining of mucous membrane.</p>

<p>The empty bladder is always collapsed, its walls being
in apposition. A median sagittal section of the bladder
and urethra shows a <span class="sans">Y</span>-shaped fissure lying between the
symphysis pubis and the uterus, the uterus lying anteverted
upon the upper surface of the bladder.</p>

<p>For convenience of description the bladder is divided
into three parts&mdash;the corpus, or body, the fundus, or base;
and the cervix, or neck.</p>

<p>The body of the bladder is all that portion that lies
above the plane of the vesical orifices of the ureters and
the center of the symphysis pubis.</p>

<p>The part lying below this plane is the base.</p>

<p>The vesical triangle, or the trigone, is that triangular
area in the base of the bladder, the angles of which are
marked by the vesical orifices of the ureters and the internal
meatus of the urethra.</p>

<p>The neck of the bladder is the funnel-shaped portion
where the bladder merges into the urethra.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane of the bladder is covered partly
with squamous, partly with cylindrical epithelium. The
mucous membrane is loosely attached to the muscular
coat throughout the body of the bladder, so that when
the organ is contracted the membrane is thrown into uneven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
folds. The mucous membrane is much more closely
attached to the underlying structures in the region of the
vesical triangle, and it here preserves a smooth surface
when the bladder is collapsed.</p>

<p>The vesical triangle is more richly supplied with
nerves than are the other portions of the bladder, and is
consequently the most sensitive portion.</p>

<p>The vesical orifice of the ureter appears as a dimple, a
small truncated cone, or a pin-hole or slit on the mucous
membrane.</p>

<p>A transverse band or fold of mucous membrane, known
as the intra-ureteral ligament, extends between the orifices
of the ureters.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the vesical triangle are subject to
individual variations. The triangle is usually equilateral,
its sides varying from 1 to 1½ inches in length. The
vesical orifices of the ureters are therefore situated at
points lying from ½ to ¾ of an inch from the median
line&mdash;a useful fact to remember in opening the bladder
through the vagina.</p>

<p>The vascular supply of the bladder is intimately associated
with that of the uterus&mdash;a fact that explains the
sympathetic disturbance of the bladder in uterine disease.
The interior of the normal bladder is of a dull
gray-red color. When distended, as in making an endoscopic
examination, the minute arteries and veins may
be plainly seen upon the surface.</p>

<p>The pressure of the urine in the bladder may be determined
by the manometer. In the erect posture the intra-vesical
pressure has been found to vary from 12 to 16
inches of mercury. In the recumbent posture the pressure
is reduced to from 4 to 6 inches.</p>

<p><b id="CYSTITIS">Cystitis.</b>&mdash;Cystitis, especially of the subacute or the
chronic form, is a common disease in women. The
pathological changes resemble those seen in inflammation
of mucous membrane in other parts of the body.</p>

<p>In the acute stage the mucous membrane is swollen
and relaxed, and of a deep-red or hyperemic appearance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
Partial exfoliation takes place. The surface may be
covered with thick, tenacious mucus or pus.</p>

<p>In the chronic stage the mucous membrane is of a
muddy gray color, and may be more or less covered with
a muco-purulent secretion. Ulceration, superficial or
deep, may occur. The ulcer is sometimes deep and
ragged and extends into the muscular wall.</p>

<p>In chronic cystitis we often find on the surface of the
mucous membrane small localized areas of inflammation
varying in size from ½ inch to 2 inches in diameter, and
presenting a congested, granular, or eroded appearance,
while the rest of the mucous membrane appears perfectly
normal. These areas of inflammation bleed readily when
touched. They are most often found in the base of the
bladder, though they may occur in any part. When
chronic cystitis is limited, it is usually confined to the
vesical triangle.</p>

<p>The outer coats of the bladder may be involved in the
inflammatory process, and become much thickened and
hypertrophied. The ureters and the kidneys may become
in time affected, through direct extension of the
inflammation in the form of a ureteritis and pyelitis, or
through obstruction of the vesical orifice of the ureters
from inflammatory thickening. The alteration in the
character of the urine is usually marked except in the
mild forms of chronic inflammation. The specific gravity
is low, varying from 1005 to 1018. In the chronic
disease the urine is alkaline and ammoniacal. It contains
blood, mucus, pus, and epithelial cells from the
vesical mucosa.</p>

<p>Cystitis in women is usually caused by infection at
catheterization. The very great improvement in the
asepsis of this procedure that has taken place in recent
years has in a corresponding degree diminished the frequency
of cystitis.</p>

<p>Infection at catheterization is caused not only by the
use of a dirty catheter, but by the conveyance of septic
material from the external genitals or the urethra into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
the bladder. For this reason the nurse or the physician
should never pass the catheter by touch, as was sometimes
formerly taught. The parts should be exposed to
view, and the external genitals, vestibule, and meatus
should be cleansed.</p>

<p>Cystitis may also be caused by extension of urethritis;
by inflammation of adjacent organs; by abnormal urine;
by constitutional diseases, as the exanthemata; by injuries
to the bladder and displacement of this organ;
and by retention of urine.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;The symptoms of cystitis vary with the
stage and the character of the affection. Pain, frequent
urination, and tenesmus are usually present.</p>

<p>In the acute stages there may be an elevation of
temperature. There is a feeling of fulness in the
bladder, with pain in the region of this organ. The
pain is increased by motion and by the erect position,
which increases the intra-vesical pressure. The pain
is constant, and is not relieved by evacuation of the
bladder. Pressure upon the base of the bladder through
the vagina causes pain. This is a useful diagnostic point.
There is a frequent desire to urinate, and the passage of
urine is followed by straining efforts or tenesmus. The
alteration in the character of the urine has already been
mentioned.</p>

<p>In time the general system suffers from secondary renal
disease and from absorption, through the bladder, of the
ingredients of decomposed urine and septic material from
the mucous membrane.</p>

<p>The <i>diagnosis</i> of cystitis is easily made by proper examination.
It should always be remembered that not
every woman who complains of painful and frequent
urination and vesical tenesmus is necessarily suffering
with cystitis. These symptoms are often caused by disease
of the urethra, by displacement of the uterus, which
drags upon the neck of the bladder, by the pressure of a
tumor, or by displacement of the bladder such as may
follow laceration of the perineum.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span></p>

<p>Women may often be seen who have been treated for
weeks for cystitis without avail, and who are immediately
relieved of all symptoms by the replacement of a retroverted
uterus or the closure of a torn perineum. These
conditions may in time result in cystitis, but the disease
usually disappears with the cure of the causative lesion.</p>

<p>It is of the first importance, therefore, for the physician
to make a careful pelvic examination, and to exclude all
conditions that might cause irritation of the bladder.
Microscopic examination of the urine, by revealing the
presence of pus and blood and the epithelial cells of the
bladder, is of value in making a diagnosis. The urine
for examination should be drawn with the catheter, to
prevent contamination from vaginal discharges.</p>

<p>Examination of the urine does not, as a rule, enable
one to exclude inflammation of the ureters or of the pelves
of the kidneys. If there is any doubt, it may be removed
by the use of the endoscope, which will reveal the
true condition of the bladder-wall.</p>

<p>As has already been said, tenderness upon pressure
through the vagina on the base of the bladder is of diagnostic
value in determining the presence of cystitis. In
the mild forms of chronic cystitis&mdash;those characterized by
local areas of inflammation&mdash;examination of the urine
may throw no light upon the condition, as the secretion
of pus or mucus is very slight. The diagnosis can then
be made only by means of the endoscope.</p>

<p>It is perhaps advisable in all cases of chronic cystitis to
use the endoscope, not only to confirm the diagnosis, but
to begin the treatment by making direct local applications.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The treatment of cystitis is general and
local. Local treatment should never be used in the acute
stages of the disease. Many cases recover completely
without any local treatment whatever.</p>

<p>In acute cystitis the woman should be put to bed. The
irritation of the bladder is much relieved when the intra-vesical
pressure is thus diminished.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span></p>

<p>The diet should be carefully regulated, all stimulating
ingredients being withdrawn. An exclusive milk diet is
the best.</p>

<p>Saline laxatives should be administered, and continued
to the point of mild purgation. One dram of Rochelle
salts every two or three hours, given in half a tumblerful
of soda-water, is useful for this purpose. Large
quantities of diluent drinks should be given, such as flaxseed
tea or Vichy water.</p>

<p>If the urine is acid, citrate of potassium may be administered
with the diluent drinks, so that from 1 to 2
drams of the salt are taken during the day. Bicarbonate
of potassium in similar doses is also useful.</p>

<p>When the urine becomes ammoniacal, boracic acid, in
doses of 10 grains from three to six times a day, is most
useful. Benzoic acid, in doses of 10 grains three or four
times a day, is also valuable.</p>

<p>A very good method is to make a pint or a quart of
flaxseed tea, to dissolve in it the requisite amount of
citrate of potassium or of boracic acid (as the urine is
acid or alkaline), and to administer this in divided doses
during the day. This treatment, with rest in bed, should
be continued as long as the vesical pain and tenesmus
continue.</p>

<p>If the pain and tenesmus are severe, small doses of
opium may be given. It is, however, not advisable to
use opium unless the suffering of the woman demands it.</p>

<p>If the disease, as the symptoms become less acute, does
not progress satisfactorily toward cure, medicines that
have a more stimulating effect upon the mucous membrane
should be given, such as cubebs and copaiba, oil
of turpentine, oil of eucalyptus, and oil of sandalwood.</p>

<p>Many cases of acute cystitis, if carefully treated in this
way, will recover completely without the use of local
treatment. If, however, the disease does not yield to
these measures, local treatment becomes necessary.</p>

<p>In many instances the woman first comes under treatment
when the disease has reached a chronic stage; or it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
may be that the disease has begun subacutely, and has
gradually progressed without having presented any
symptoms of acute onset. Local combined with general
treatment is then often advisable from the beginning.</p>

<p><i>Local treatment</i> consists of general applications made
to the whole of the interior of the bladder through the
catheter; direct application, limited to the diseased portions
of the mucous membrane, through the endoscope;
and operation, or the formation of a vesico-vaginal fistula.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_191" src="images/fig_191.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 191.</span>&mdash;Apparatus for washing the bladder.</p></div>

<p>Washing out the bladder with sterile warm water,
either pure or medicated, is often very useful. Gentleness
in manipulation and asepsis should be carefully observed
in this procedure, or much more harm than good
may result from it. The operation, if properly performed,
should never give pain to the woman.</p>

<p>A very simple apparatus is required, consisting of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
soft-rubber catheter, of moderate size, attached to a small
glass funnel by means of a rubber tube and a piece of
glass tubing. The whole is about 2 feet long (<a href="#fig_191">Fig. 191</a>).</p>

<p>The catheter, slightly lubricated at the point, should
be gently introduced into the bladder, and the urine
should be slowly withdrawn. As the urine flows into the
funnel its character may be observed. The rapidity of
the flow of the urine may be regulated by raising or lowering
the funnel. As the last portion of the urine is
withdrawn the flow should be very slow, in order to prevent
injury to the vesical mucous membrane from dragging
it into the eye of the catheter.</p>

<p>When the bladder is emptied, sterile hot water may be
introduced through the funnel and the process of withdrawal
repeated. The mucus, pus, or blood which had
remained in the bladder after evacuating the urine may
be examined as the water flows into the funnel. This
process may be repeated several times if necessary to
wash out the bladder. The water should be about the
temperature of the body (100° F.). It is less irritating
to the mucous membrane if there is dissolved in it boracic
acid or common table salt, about 1 dram to the pint,
though these ingredients should not be added if they
act chemically on the substances subsequently used in the
medicated solution.</p>

<p>The quantity of water introduced into the bladder may
be regulated by the feelings of the patient. The distention
of the bladder should never be great enough to cause
pain. Usually an ounce of fluid is all that can at first
be tolerated without producing pain. As improvement
takes place more fluid may be introduced in the subsequent
treatments.</p>

<p>After the bladder has been washed out in this way,
applications may be made to the interior by pouring
through the funnel the desired medicated solution, the
most useful one being a weak solution of nitrate of silver
(gr. j or ij to ℥j). This solution should be retained in the
bladder for a few minutes, and should then be withdrawn.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span></p>

<p>A solution of sulphate of copper (gr. j-iv to ℥j) is also
useful.</p>

<p>At first daily irrigation and application should be thus
practised. As the case improves the intervals between
the treatments should be lengthened.</p>

<p>This local treatment should always be combined with
the general treatment already prescribed&mdash;rest in bed if
possible, a milk diet, and the administration of boracic
acid internally.</p>

<p><i>Application through the Endoscope.</i>&mdash;If the endoscope
is used in the first place for diagnosis in a case of chronic
cystitis, much time that might otherwise be wasted in
unnecessary or useless forms of treatment may be saved.
The condition of the parts maybe accurately determined,
and the proper form of treatment may be instituted. It
may, for instance, be seen that deep ulceration is present,
or that other lesions of the bladder are so extensive that
the quickest plan of cure will be to proceed immediately
to the formation of a vesico-vaginal fistula, without attempting
to treat the disease by applications.</p>

<p>Applications may be readily made through the endoscope
to any part of the interior of the bladder. Applications
made in this way are most useful when the disease
is localized. Stronger solutions may be used on the
affected areas than when the application is made to the
whole surface of the organ.</p>

<p>When the disease is limited to the vesical triangle or
to local areas situated elsewhere, the inflamed spots
should be touched with a solution of nitrate of silver
(gr. v-xx to ℥j). Much benefit is frequently derived from
one such application, in connection with the general
treatment already indicated. The applications may be
made every few days. The procedure causes less discomfort
to the woman as she becomes accustomed to it.</p>

<p><i>Cystotomy.</i>&mdash;In cases of ulceration of the mucous membrane,
or when the disease has resisted the milder forms
of treatment, it may become necessary to perform cystotomy,
to furnish an opening for the continuous drain of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
the urine, and to put the bladder at rest by relieving it
from all functional action. This is a most valuable therapeutic
operation in cases of obstinate cystitis.</p>

<p>In performing cystotomy the anatomical relations of
the ureters and the internal orifice of the urethra must
be kept in mind. It will be remembered that the ureters
terminate in the bladder at points situated from ½ to ¾
of an inch from the median line.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_192" src="images/fig_192.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 192.</span>&mdash;Illustration of the position of the incision in vaginal cystotomy,
and the relations of the urethra and the ureters: <i>A</i>, anterior vaginal column;
<i>B</i> marks the position of the internal urinary meatus; <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> mark the orifices
of the ureters. The distance from <i>C</i> to <i>D</i> varies from 1 to 1½ inches. <i>C</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>D</i>
is approximately an equilateral triangle.</p></div>

<p>The course of the urethra is indicated by the anterior
vaginal column, which is a single or double thickening
of mucous membrane traversed by short transverse folds
or ridges. It begins near the external meatus and extends
upward for about an inch. The internal meatus may be
very approximately located by the upper end of this anterior
vaginal column. The incision into the bladder
should be made in the median line above this point.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span></p>

<p>The operation should be performed under the influence
of an anesthetic. The woman should be placed in the
Sims or the dorso-sacral position. The anterior vaginal
wall should be exposed with the Sims speculum. A
sound should be passed into the bladder, and its point
should be pressed against the posterior vesical wall
toward the vagina, at the position where the incision is
to be made. The incision should be made into the bladder
through the tissues fixed on the point of the sound.
The opening may then be enlarged with the knife or
scissors. The opening should be from 1 to 1½ inches in
length. In order to prevent spontaneous closure of the
fistula, the mucous membrane of the bladder should be
sutured to the mucous membrane of the urethra around
the margin of the fistula.</p>

<p>The after-treatment consists in daily washing of the
bladder with large quantities of sterile warm water or
with the boracic-acid solution. The woman should be
placed in the dorso-sacral position, and the fistulous opening
should be exposed by the Sims speculum. The water
should be introduced into the bladder through the urethra.
Care must be taken to hold the edges of the fistula
open, so that there may be a free channel of escape.</p>

<p>The patient should at first remain in bed. After the
acute symptoms have disappeared she may get up and
the frequency of the local treatments may be diminished.
Various appliances have been introduced for receiving
the continuously escaping urine. None of them, however,
are satisfactory. They are difficult to keep clean,
they cause pain, and they are liable to become displaced.
The best method is to wear a vulvar pad of some absorbent
material and to pay strict attention to cleanliness.
The progress of the case may be determined by examination
of the urine, and by examination of the vesical
mucous membrane through the fistula or through the
endoscope.</p>

<p>The time required for cure may extend from one to six
months.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span></p>

<p>When the vesical membrane has been restored to a
normal condition the fistula may be readily closed.</p>

<p><b id="VESICAL_CALCULUS">Vesical Calculus.</b>&mdash;Stone in the bladder is less common
among women than among men. This fact is probably
due to the greater size and dilatability of the female
urethra, on account of which small calculi may readily
pass out.</p>

<p>The symptoms and methods of diagnosis of vesical
calculus are similar to those in the male. The stone
may often be palpated by bimanual examination.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Small stones uncomplicated with cystitis
may be crushed and removed through the urethra. Large
stones should be removed by cystotomy. Whenever
cystitis is present, it is advisable to perform cystotomy
and to make a permanent fistula until the cystitis is
cured, when the opening may be readily closed.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<h3 id="GONORRHEA_IN_WOMEN">GONORRHEA IN WOMEN.</h3>

<p>Gonorrhea in women has been considered disconnectedly
in the preceding pages as one of several pathological
conditions that affect the different parts of the
genital tract. A more connected discussion of the subject
will be of value, in view of the frequency of the
disease, its often unsuspected or insidious character, and
the serious and fatal lesions that it may produce. Lying
between the two specialties of venereal diseases and gynecology,
it is often ignored or slighted by both.</p>

<p>Acute gonorrhea in the female is much less frequent
than in the male. It is rare in the gynecological dispensaries
of Philadelphia to see acute gonorrhea of any
part of the genito-urinary tract.</p>

<p>The disease is very often subacute or chronic from the
beginning, and is not, as in the male, always preceded
by a period of acute invasion, the symptoms of which
necessarily attract the attention of the patient and the
physician. For this reason gonorrhea in the woman is
very often overlooked. We can as yet form no accurate
estimate of its frequency. Certain lesions, such as pyosalpinx,
which may be the remote result of gonorrhea,
are often, especially by gynecologists, indiscriminately
attributed to this disease without anything like sufficient
evidence of such a causative relation.</p>

<p>The fact that the husband may at some time of his
life have had gonorrhea, or even that the woman may
have had gonorrhea, is no evidence that a pyosalpinx
that appears in later years has been caused by this disease.
There are many other causes of pyosalpinx besides
gonorrhea. The frequent causative relation of sepsis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
at labor, miscarriage, or criminal abortion, or during
the intra-uterine manipulations of the physician, should
always be remembered.</p>

<p>I have no intention of underrating the danger to the
woman of coitus with a man who is not entirely cured
of a gonorrhea or a gleet. The lives of a great many
women have been ruined by marriage with incompletely
cured gonorrheal husbands, and but very few men in such
a condition would contemplate marriage if they were
aware of the danger to the woman that results from such
an act. But, on the other hand, men who are at all careful
of themselves are, without doubt, usually completely
cured of gonorrhea; and there are thousands of men in
the community who have had one or more attacks of
gonorrhea before marriage, and who have now healthy
and prolific wives. Every physician of experience will
find such examples in the circle of his own practice or
acquaintance. It is very unscientific to lay the responsibility
upon such husbands for every pelvic inflammatory
condition that may appear in their wives.</p>

<p>The difficulty of proving the presence of gonorrhea in
women is often very great. As has been said, the disease
may begin and may exist for a long time without attracting
the attention of the woman. She often pays no attention
to a slight burning or tickling sensation in the
urethra, which passes off in a few days. She may have
had a leucorrheal discharge for a long time, and she may
fail to notice any slight alteration in its character or quantity
that may have been caused by gonorrhea.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the gross appearance of the discharge
from any part of the genital tract which is absolutely
pathognomonic of gonorrhea. The condition may
be suspected if there is a purulent discharge from the
urethra, because urethritis in women is very generally of
gonorrheal origin. But, on the other hand, there may be
an innocent-looking mucous discharge from the cervix,
such as occurs in health or in mild non-specific conditions,
yet in which gonococci may be found.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span></p>

<p>The presence of the gonococcus is, of course, positive
evidence of gonorrhea. But this organism may be present
in small numbers and escape detection even at the
hands of experienced observers; or it may be present in
the tissues of the infected region and fail to appear in
the discharge; or it may in time itself disappear altogether.
And thus, when the woman begins to suffer from
some of the remote lesions of gonorrhea, such as an endometritis
or a salpingitis, and is driven to seek medical
advice, she may be unable to give any history whatever
of the beginning of the disease; the character of the
secretions may teach the physician nothing; the gonococcus
may have disappeared from the genital discharge;
and though a pyosalpinx may be present which had
originally been caused by gonorrhea, yet the gonococcus
may likewise have disappeared from the tubal pus, and
other pathogenic organisms may be found in its place.
It becomes impossible to determine the true origin of the
disease.</p>

<p>For these reasons, if the physician is accurate in his
observations, and classifies as gonorrheal only those cases
the specific origin of which he can prove, the frequency
of gonorrheal lesions in women will be considerably
understated.</p>

<p>Sanger states that in about one-eighth of all gynecological
diseases gonorrhea is the underlying cause. Taylor,
viewing the condition from the side of the venereal
specialist, says that this statement is conservative and
probably nearly correct.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that gonorrhea is sometimes
caused in other ways than by coitus. This is seen in the
epidemics of gonorrhea that occur in children. It is without
doubt sometimes caused by the use of an infected
vaginal syringe. Cases of rectal gonorrhea are not infrequently
thus produced.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea in women may attack any part of the genito-urinary
tract. It rarely attacks a number of structures
at one time, but it usually becomes localized in one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
or two parts, such as the urethra, the glands of the vestibule,
the vulvo-vaginal glands, the vaginal fornices, or
the cervix uteri, and runs a subacute course, and may remain
quiescent for a long period. It may in time disappear
spontaneously, or it may be excited into activity
by a variety of causes, such as traumatism, unusual
coitus, labor, or miscarriage. The parts of the genito-urinary
apparatus that are covered by pavement epithelium
are much more resistant to the gonococcus than are
the parts covered with cylindrical epithelium. For this
reason the external genital surface and the vagina of the
woman, and the vaginal aspect of the cervix, are often
exempt when other less resistant structures are attacked.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea attacks the different parts in the following
order of frequency: the urethra, the cervix uteri, the
vulva, and the vagina.</p>

<p><i>Gonorrhea of the urethra</i> is the most common form of
the disease. The great majority of the cases of urethritis
in women are of gonorrheal origin. Whenever there is
a purulent or muco-purulent discharge from the urethra
gonorrhea should be suspected, whether or not the gonococcus
is found in it.</p>

<p>The disease may linger in the mucous glands found
near the external meatus and in Skene’s glands for a long
time. The symptoms of this condition have already been
considered. The disease may present all the phenomena
of acute urethritis in the male, or it may be subacute
from the beginning.</p>

<p><i>Gonorrhea of the cervix uteri</i> occurs next in frequency.
As far as the few accurate observations that have been
made teach us anything, gonorrhea of the cervix is but
little less frequent than gonorrhea of the urethra. The
disease may exist in conjunction with gonorrhea of some
other part, or it may occur alone. The infection takes
place directly from the discharge of the penis which
comes in contact with the external os. Gonorrhea of
the cervix usually begins in a subacute or an insidious
manner. It is usually unattended by any general or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
local symptoms sufficiently marked to attract attention.
If the woman had been free from a leucorrheal discharge,
she may observe a muco-purulent secretion caused by the
gonorrhea. If she had a leucorrhea, the alteration in
the character and amount of the discharge is usually
not sufficient to attract her attention. In some cases the
discharge becomes more purulent in character; in others
there is no alteration perceptible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>If the disease runs an acute course, the appearance of
the cervix will be that characteristic of acute inflammation.
The vaginal cervix is congested; the external os
is patulous and is surrounded by a red granular or eroded
area, while from it is seen escaping a purulent discharge.</p>

<p>Pelvic pain or discomfort is not usually present unless
the body of the uterus is attacked.</p>

<p>All the symptoms of gonorrheal inflammation of the
cervix are found in simple non-specific conditions. The
only certain diagnosis is made by means of the microscope;
and even failure to find the gonococcus will not
enable the physician to say with certainty that the disease
is not of gonorrheal origin. The gonococcus may
be found in any form of discharge from the cervix, even
that which to gross examination appears most innocent.</p>

<p>Consequently, in every suspected case a microscopic
examination should be made.</p>

<p>The discharge, for examination, should be taken from
the cavity of the cervix by means of a sterile platinum
loop. If no gonococci are found, a strip of mucous
membrane from the cervical canal should be removed
with a sharp curette, and it, with the discharge that adheres
to it, should be carefully examined.</p>

<p>It may be advisable to examine the discharge immediately
after menstruation. A cervical discharge is always
increased immediately before, during, and after a menstrual
period. This is probably the reason that men are
more liable to contract gonorrhea at that time. This fact
is so well known that there is a widespread popular belief
that gonorrhea may be acquired from coitus, during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
a menstrual period, with a healthy woman. This is not
true. A man cannot acquire gonorrhea from a woman
unless she had been previously infected with the disease;
otherwise a woman might develop gonorrhea in herself
spontaneously, for her discharges come in contact with
her own genito-urinary tract.</p>

<p>The greater liability to infection at the time of menstruation
is due to the fact that an existing pathological
discharge is increased in amount; a subacute disease is
rendered more active by the menstrual congestion; and
gonococci, quiescent in the superficial cells, are more
likely to be thrown off at this time.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea of the cervix very often stops at the internal
os. It may, however, extend to the body of the uterus
and to the Fallopian tubes, as has already been described.
The diagnosis of gonorrheal endometritis can be made
only by microscopic examination of the discharge or of
a strip of the endometrium removed with the curette.</p>

<p>The gonorrheal discharge of the cervix may infect,
secondarily, local areas of the vagina. The most usual
position of secondary infection is the posterior vaginal
fornix. A red eroded area, caused in this way, is often
found. The prolonged contact of the pus produces a
localized vaginal gonorrhea.</p>

<p>Primary <i>vaginal gonorrhea</i> is rare in the adult woman,
in whom there is the usual resistant power of the epithelium.
The mucous membrane of the vagina becomes
tough from coitus and childbirth, and is usually impregnable
to the gonococcus. Bumm has kept gonorrheal
pus in contact with the vaginal wall for twelve hours
without producing any inflammatory reaction.</p>

<p>In girls and in young women, in whom the mucous
membrane of the vagina is soft and hyperemic, vaginal
gonorrhea is more likely to occur. Like gonorrhea in
other parts, the disease may be acute or chronic. It may
involve the whole vaginal tract or it may be restricted to
local areas.</p>

<p>The disease sometimes involves only the lower portion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
of the vagina, and is most severe on the posterior wall.
In other cases it is limited to the posterior vaginal fornix,
where it has a tendency to become localized and to persist.
In the very early stage the mucous membrane is dry and
red. It later becomes covered with a purulent or muco-purulent
secretion of a milky color.</p>

<p>If the disease is extensive, severe symptoms may be
present. The woman will suffer with burning pain in
the pelvis, the pain being increased by any movement.</p>

<p>Acute inflammation of the vagina is usually of gonorrheal
origin. A thorough examination of the condition
can be made only by placing the woman in the knee-chest
position and by exposing the vagina by retracting
the perineum with the Sims speculum. The whole vaginal
tube, especially the posterior wall near the ostium
and the fornices, should be carefully inspected.</p>

<p><i>Gonorrhea of the vulva</i> may arise primarily, or it may
be caused by infection from discharge from the vagina or
the cervix. Like gonorrhea of the vagina, it is rare in
the adult woman. It is usually seen in girls or in young
women. Its occurrence in children has already been
referred to.</p>

<p>The disease may extend to the small glands of the
vestibule and the fourchette and to Bartholini’s glands;
in these situations it may lurk for many years, forming a
source of infection to men and a great element of danger
to the woman. Suppuration of the glands of the vestibule
may result in small urethral fistulæ.</p>

<p>In making an examination of the external genitals the
parts should always be thoroughly exposed and the physician
should attempt to express the fluid from the orifices
of the glands. Microscopic examination of the discharge
should be made.</p>

<p>Inflammation of any of the glands of the external genitals
is usually the result of gonorrhea.</p>

<p>When the physician examines a woman suspected of
gonorrhea, she should not prepare herself beforehand by
vaginal douches and washing the external genitals. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
urine should not have been voided for some time. Prostitutes,
fearing that gonorrhea will be discovered, often
remove all discharges as much as possible before they
submit to examination. Other women do the same from
motives of cleanliness. As the diagnosis depends upon
observation of the origin and character of the discharges,
such preparation should be avoided.</p>

<p>As has already been said, it may be advisable in doubtful
cases to make the examination immediately after a
menstrual period, when the discharges are more profuse
and perhaps more virulent than at other times. The examiner
should always proceed methodically, and should
inspect every portion of the external genitals, the vagina,
and the cervix. The vestibule, the external meatus, the
urethra, the fourchette, the glands of Bartholini, the
vaginal walls, the external os, and the cervical canal
should in turn be examined. Discharges obtained from
these structures should be saved and submitted to microscopic
examination.</p>

<p>Though the gonococcus is by no means always found
in cases the specific character of which is proved by infection
of the man, yet it would escape observation much
less often if such thorough examination were made.</p>

<p>If the gonococcus is not found, the diagnosis must be
made from the consideration of the lesions that we know
occur but rarely except in gonorrhea. Thus, urethritis
is a strong diagnostic point in favor of gonorrhea; so is
inflammation of the glands of the vestibule, of the fourchette,
and of the vulvo-vaginal glands. Vaginitis not
caused by the degenerations of old age, by traumatism,
or by the discharge from a cancer of the cervix or from a
vesico-vaginal fistula is usually of gonorrheal origin.
This is especially true of vaginitis localized in the vaginal
fornices.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea in women should be most carefully treated
until all signs of the disease are eradicated. The treatment
has already been discussed under the consideration
of the different structures that may be attacked. Gonorrheal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
cervicitis and endometritis are the most difficult to
cure, and it may be impossible to determine with certainty
that the disease has been eradicated from these
structures. If milder measures fail, the cervical canal
and the body of the uterus should be completely curetted,
and the raw surface should be treated with pure carbolic
acid. The physician should never discharge the patient
until she is thoroughly cured.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<h3 id="THE_TECHNIQUE_OF_GYNECOLOGICAL_OPERATIONS">THE TECHNIQUE OF GYNECOLOGICAL OPERATIONS.</h3>

<p>The technique of some of the special gynecological
operations, such as perineorrhaphy, and trachelorrhaphy,
has already been considered in discussing the treatment
of the conditions in which such operations are applicable.
The general and local preparation of the patient, the
instruments, the dressings, etc., and the technique of the
general operations of gynecology that are applicable to a
variety of different pathological conditions, such as oöphorectomy
and hysterectomy, now demand consideration.
The general rules of asepsis that are followed in gynecological
operations are the same as those that should be
observed in all surgical operations. And although every
surgeon should strive to attain perfect asepsis in all operations,
yet it is of especial importance for the gynecologist
to do so, for he, more often than all others, invades
the peritoneal cavity. Of the various structures of the
body, the peritoneum is one of the most susceptible to
septic influences; and septic infection of the peritoneum,
unlike infection of other structures, implies not merely
a local disturbance and delay of healing, but general
sepsis and death.</p>

<p>Moreover, the gynecologist, operating in the peritoneum,
cannot correct any imperfection in his aseptic
technique by the use of antiseptic solutions, as can be
done in other operations of general surgery. Such antiseptic
solutions, if of sufficient strength to be of any value
as germicides, are very dangerous in the peritoneum.
They may produce fatal poisoning from absorption
through the peritoneum; they destroy the delicate peritoneal
surface, and thus diminish the very useful power
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
of the peritoneum to absorb blood and serum after the
operation; they cause intestinal and other adhesions; and
they so impair the integrity of the intestinal walls that
septic organisms may be enabled to pass through and
infect the general peritoneum.</p>

<p>The gynecologist, thus debarred from the use of antiseptics
during a peritoneal operation, must rely altogether
upon the perfection of his aseptic technique.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the danger of peritoneal
infection, though very much less in the minor gynecological
operations on the perineum and the cervix, is yet
never altogether absent. The whole genital tract of
women communicates directly with the peritoneum, and
infection at any point may extend and cause fatal peritoneal
sepsis.</p>

<p>The danger increases with the proximity of the infected
point to the peritoneum. The danger of salpingitis
and peritonitis from trivial intra-uterine manipulations
not performed aseptically, such as the passage of a
dirty sound, has already been referred to. Fatal peritonitis
has followed trachelorrhaphy.</p>

<p>In the various plastic operations of gynecology disastrous
results are, of course, not so likely to occur from
imperfect asepsis as in those operations that involve
opening the peritoneum. In some of these operations,
such as closure of a vesico-vaginal or a recto-vaginal fistula,
it is impossible to obtain perfect asepsis.</p>

<p>In minor gynecological operations, however, we may
use antiseptic solutions which are inadmissible within
the peritoneum; and the vascularity of the genital tract
is so great that healing is usually rapid and perfect even
with very imperfect asepsis. This fact, however, should
never justify carelessness on the part of the physician.
In every surgical procedure, however trivial, the strictest
asepsis should always be observed. The practice avoids,
at any rate, a minimum danger; it is a useful training
for the physician; and it sets a valuable example to the
assistants and nurses. No part of the technique should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
be “good enough.” It should be as good as it can be
made.</p>

<p>The greatest factor in the success of modern gynecology
has been asepsis. The doctrine has become so
widely spread that the technique, and consequently the
results, of careless operators of the present day are much
better than those of the best operators before the days of
Listerism.</p>

<p>This is not said to justify carelessness. No woman
should at operation be exposed to any dangers not inseparable
from her condition. The assistants and the
nurses should be especially made to feel the responsibility
of their positions. A careless nurse or assistant may introduce
sepsis and cause death after the most skilfully
performed operation. Unfortunately, there is not a distinct
realization of this fact. An assistant, though conscious
of some carelessness of his own, usually beguiles
himself with the belief that death was due to some other
cause. If there were a distinct realization of personal
responsibility among all concerned at an operation, death
from infection through carelessness would be avoided as
are other kinds of manslaughter. Unless a surgeon
knows that he can furnish the proper aseptic conditions,
he has no right to advise a patient to submit to operation
unless the disease is such that operation is demanded
under any circumstances.</p>

<p>At the present day the gynecologist advises a woman
to submit to a serious&mdash;potentially fatal&mdash;operation, like
celiotomy, for the relief of many conditions which cause
suffering, but which do not cause death. He does this
conscientiously, because he knows that if the operation
is properly performed the danger to life is very small.
If he is not certain that the proper operative conditions
will be at hand, he cannot conscientiously give this advice,
and he had better follow some palliative treatment.</p>

<p>Operations are always better done in a well-equipped
operating-room than in a private house. In the operating-room
we have better asepsis, better light and mechanical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
appliances, better discipline of assistants and
nurses, and greater opportunity of successfully dealing
with unexpected complications.</p>

<p>In an operation which is performed in a private house
something is always used which is more or less of a
makeshift; and makeshifts should not be used in surgery,
especially in abdominal surgery. If we hope to obtain
perfect results, we must insist upon perfect surroundings
and appliances. Continuous success is the result of
scientific accuracy and attention to detail. I say continuous
success, because this is the only test of good
surgery. We should not be misled by occasional brilliant
results obtained under imperfect conditions. In
such circumstances the operator admits to himself that
his patient was lucky. The element of luck should
be entirely eliminated. Nothing should be trusted to
luck.</p>

<p>Fortunately, most of the operations of gynecology are
performed for conditions of such a character that there is
no demand for instant operation. The woman can usually
wait until suitable conditions are furnished. In
cases of emergency the surgeon can only do his best
under the existing circumstances, not his best under the
best circumstances.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that good results, as far as mortality
is concerned, are obtained in abdominal operations in
private houses. The mortality, however, for a long
series of cases of all kinds is greater than that obtained
in well-equipped hospitals by operators of equal ability.
The number of incomplete and imperfectly performed
operations is much greater in private houses than in the
hospital, for the operator with imperfect surroundings
fears to deal radically with some unexpected conditions
which he meets, and is satisfied if the woman’s life is
saved, though she be not perfectly cured.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to dwell upon the need of proper
training of the operator himself in abdominal surgery.
The minor gynecological operations may be performed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
by any one who is familiar with the ordinary principles
of surgery and who understands the special technique of
the operation. There is no fear of unexpected complications
in such operations. Rapidity of work is not essential,
as in abdominal surgery, and the operator may study
the condition as he proceeds; moreover, errors arising
from inexperience or ignorance are not attended by fatal
results.</p>

<p>In abdominal surgery, however, the operator should be
specially trained for the work. Except in cases of
emergency, he should not perform these operations unless
he expects to do so continuously. He should be
trained by work upon the cadaver and the lower animals
and by watching and assisting experienced operators.
He should be prepared to deal, without hesitation, with
every pathological condition that may be met with in
the abdomen; a glance at works on abdominal surgery
will show how numerous such conditions are.</p>

<p>A few successes in simple cases in the hands of an incompetent
operator will lure him on with false confidence
until he finally meets a condition with which he is unable
to cope. Either the patient dies as a result, or, if the operator
be conservative, the abdomen is closed over an incomplete
operation.</p>

<p>The directions which are about to be given apply especially
to those operations in which the peritoneal cavity
is entered. They may be modified in obvious particulars
in case a minor operation is to be performed upon the
vagina or the uterus. In such cases special abdominal
cleansing is unnecessary and complete evacuation of the
intestinal tract is not so important.</p>

<p>The technique described is that which is followed by the
writer. Various equally good modifications are employed
by other operators. It seems best, however, to give but
one rigid method which experience has proved successful.
The experienced operator is able to change it according
to his individual preferences.</p>

<p><b id="OPERATING_ROOM">Operating-room.</b>&mdash;The operating-room should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
well lighted from the top and at least one side. If a good
natural light cannot be secured, an electric drop-light
will be found very convenient. For work deep in the
pelvis or the abdomen a good light is essential. If necessary,
light may be directed to the desired point by means
of the ordinary head-mirror.</p>

<p>The floor, walls, and ceiling of the room should be of
some non-absorbing material. There should be in the
room no appliances whatever that are not essential for the
performance of the operation.</p>

<p>The interior of the room should be wiped throughout
with a mop or with wet cloths, or, still better, flushed
with the hose, in order to remove and lay all dust. The
room may be wiped throughout with a solution of bichlorid
of mercury (1:2000). At the Gynecean Hospital
the operating-rooms are disinfected once a week
with formaldehyd gas.</p>

<p>The temperature of the room should be not less than
75° F. Shock from bodily loss of heat and exposure of
the peritoneum is diminished if the atmosphere of the
room is at an elevated temperature.</p>

<p><b id="APPARATUS">Apparatus.</b>&mdash;All apparatus, such as basins, tables,
etc., should be of such a character that it may be sterilized
by boiling or by washing with a solution of bichloride
of mercury (1:1000). Glass-top tables with painted or
nickel-plated frames are preferable. The operating-table
should be so arranged that the patient may be placed in
the Trendelenburg position (<a href="#fig_193">Fig. 193</a>). This position
permits the intestines to gravitate out of the pelvis, and
is very useful in many operations. There are a great
variety of tables in use. Before the Trendelenburg posture
was introduced the writer used for several years a
plain hard-wood plank supported by two wooden horses.
The Boldt table is very convenient. With it there is no
necessity for a rubber pad for catching fluids. It is applicable
for all gynecological operations. Some operators
are in the habit of dressing the operating table by placing
on it a blanket and sheet. This is unnecessary, unless
the patient is in such a condition of collapse that it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
essential to preserve all bodily heat. The blanket usually
becomes saturated with fluids and serves no good
purpose.</p>

<p>The number and arrangement of the basins, tables,
stands, etc. used in an abdominal operation are shown in
<a href="#fig_194">Fig. 194</a>.</p>

<p>The basins are best sterilized by boiling, or by washing
with scalding water (inside and outside) and a solution
of bichloride of mercury (1:1000).</p>

<p>The tables and stands are sterilized by washing with
the bichloride solution. If wooden-top tables are used,
they should be covered with a towel wrung out of a
1:1000 bichloride solution.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_193" src="images/fig_193.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 193.</span>&mdash;Trendelenburg position.</p></div>

<p><b id="OPERATOR_ASSISTANTS_NURSES">Operator, Assistants, Nurses.</b>&mdash;Usually one assistant,
who stands opposite the operator, and two nurses, are
sufficient. A second assistant, standing beside the operator,
is useful to thread needles and to hand instruments
and ligatures. The operator, assistants, and nurses
should possess such general cleanliness as follows a
morning bath. They should not attend any patients
suffering with a septic or infectious condition upon the
day of the operation. If they have done so upon the
previous day, they should subsequently take a general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
bath and change all clothing. Care in this respect is
especially desirable on the part of the nurses, whose long
hair prevents easy cleansing of the head.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_194" src="images/fig_194.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 194.</span>&mdash;View of the sterilizing and operating rooms of the Gynecean Hospital, Philadelphia. The apparatus is arranged for operation. <i>A</i>, flasks
of sterile water; <i>B</i>, jar containing silk ligatures in glass tubes; <i>C</i>, instrument-sterilizer containing boiling water; <i>D</i>, tray containing sterile water for instruments
at operation; <i>E</i>, basin for washing sponges; <i>F</i>, basin for washing hands of operator during operation; <i>G</i>, tray for sutures, ligatures, and needles; <i>H</i>,
jar of cold sterile water; <i>J</i>, kettle of hot sterile water; <i>K</i>, water-sterilizer; <i>L</i>, dressing-sterilizer.</p></div>

<p>The operator and assistants should wear sterilized outer
clothes&mdash;cotton shirt and duck trousers. A large sterilized
apron put on immediately before the operation is an
additional protection. The nurses should wear large
sterilized aprons over freshly washed, if not sterilized,
dresses.</p>

<p>The hands and forearms of the operator, assistants, and
nurses should be bare and especially sterilized. The
finger-nails should be short, rounded, and smooth. A
long nail is difficult to clean, and in the case of the operator
is dangerous, as it may lacerate important structures
in the process of enucleation of a tumor. Enucleation
of adherent growths is best done with the blunt finger,
which passes along the planes of separation. The sharp
nail may perforate an intestine or lacerate a blood-vessel,
instead of pushing it aside.</p>

<p>The nails, fingers, hands, forearms, and lower part of
the upper arms should be thoroughly scrubbed with frequently
changed hot water and soap (preferably soft soap)
and a large stiff nail-brush. The process should not be
done hastily or but once. The soap should be repeatedly
washed off and renewed. Five minutes, at least, should be
devoted to the scrubbing. The hands and arms should then
be similarly scrubbed with alcohol, and finally scrubbed
with a solution of bichloride of mercury 1:1000. Immediately
before proceeding with the operation the hands
and arms should be rinsed in sterile water.</p>

<p>There should be a nail-brush for each solution used.
The brushes should be clean and sterilized by boiling
or by placing in the steam sterilizer.</p>

<p>After sterilizing the hands, the operator, the assistants,
and nurses should touch nothing which is not sterile. If
they are obliged to do so, the hands should be again
washed.</p>

<p>Rubber gloves, such as are used in general surgery, are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
very useful in the operations of gynecology. They may
be worn to protect the patient in case the operator or the
assistants are not certain of the sterility of their hands,
or to protect the operator when working upon a septic
patient. Rubber gloves should be sterilized in the steam
sterilizer.</p>

<p><b id="STERILIZATION_OF_DRESSINGS_TOWELS_ETC">Sterilization of Dressings, Towels, etc.</b>&mdash;The operating-cloths,
aprons, sheets, towels, dressings, gauze
pads, etc. are most conveniently sterilized by steam heat.
The temperature should be at least 100° C. (212° F.).
The dressings and bandages should not be too tightly
packed, so that all parts may be exposed to the same
temperature.</p>

<p>Several kinds of steam sterilizers have been introduced.
The most easily obtained is the Arnold sterilizer. An
apparatus like the Sprague sterilizer, in which the steam
is superheated, is preferable, but, as it is not portable, it
is adapted only for hospital use.</p>

<p>The dressings should be maintained at the elevated
temperature for an hour or more. Although this method
secures very good sterilization, yet there are certain spores
which resist such elevated temperature even after a two
hours’ exposure. The method of <i>fractional</i> or <i>discontinuous
sterilisation</i> has therefore been introduced. Two
or three successive sterilizations are practised at intervals
of twenty-four hours. Spores which at first escape
destruction will have developed into vegetative forms in
the intervals, and are destroyed by the final sterilizations.</p>

<p>At the Gynecean Hospital all dressings are sterilized
for three consecutive days for two hours each day. The
dressings, towels, etc., after sterilization, should be preserved
in sterile glass jars or other sterile receptacle.</p>

<p><b id="STERILIZATION_OF_INSTRUMENTS">Sterilization of Instruments.</b>&mdash;Instruments, drainage-tubes,
catheters, and any rubber appliance may be
sterilized by boiling in water for fifteen to thirty minutes.
A dilute solution (1 per cent.) of carbonate of
soda is preferable, as the instruments are not so easily
rusted, and this solution, when boiling, has greater germicidal
qualities than plain water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span></p>

<p>Very convenient instrument-sterilizers are made, in
which the instruments are contained in a tray that may
be lifted out and placed in the receptacle for containing
the instruments during the operation. This receptacle or
pan should itself be sterilized, and should contain sterile
water, or preferably the sterile solution of bicarbonate of
soda, in sufficient quantity to cover the instruments.</p>

<p>It is very convenient to keep on hand a saturated solution
of carbonate of soda, sterilized by boiling, a small
quantity of which may be added to the water in the instrument-tray.
Rusting of instruments is diminished by
this means.</p>

<p>Appliances that are injured by moist heat or by steam
may be sterilized by thorough washing and soaking in a
solution of bichloride of mercury (1:1000). It is useful
to keep a large vessel of such a solution on hand, in
which apparatus that is not injured by the bichloride
may be placed.</p>

<p><b id="THE_WATER">The Water.</b>&mdash;The water used during the operation,
for washing the wound, the abdominal cavity, the
sponges, and the hands of the operator and assistants,
should be sterilized by boiling or by distillation. The
water should be boiled for two hours a day on two consecutive
days, or it should be boiled under pressure as in
some of the modern water-sterilizers. If the water contain
a perceptible sediment, it should first be filtered.</p>

<p>Very convenient water-sterilizers are made, from which
the water may be drawn of any desired temperature, after
having been both filtered and sterilized by heat. There
should always be a large quantity of sterile hot water at
hand. Water below the temperature of the body should
not be introduced in the peritoneal cavity, and pads
brought in contact with the intestines should be wrung
out of hot water.</p>

<p>About fifteen gallons of sterile water are usually required
in an abdominal operation.</p>

<p>The water should be preserved in sterile pitchers,
basins, or other receptacles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span></p>

<p>Glass flasks are very convenient for containing the water
with which the abdomen or pelvis may be washed out.
The water may be poured directly into the abdomen from
the flask. The flask should be plugged with non-absorbent
cotton to prevent the entrance of dust.</p>

<p>Some operators prefer to use a normal salt solution
(sodium chloride gr. 90 to water ℥xxxiiiss) for washing
out the peritoneum. Such a solution is probably less
irritating to the peritoneum than plain water.</p>

<p>If the flasks are used for containing the water, it may
be boiled in them, and then preserved by plugging with
absorbent cotton until required at the operation. The
temperature of the water used for abdominal irrigation
should be 100° to 115° F.</p>

<p><b id="SPONGES">Sponges.</b>&mdash;In the minor operations about the vagina
or uterus the field of operation may be kept clean by
irrigation with sterile water or by the use of sponges.
Small sponges in holders are commonly used. These
sponges, after being washed free of sand and bleached if
necessary, may be sterilized by soaking for twelve hours
in a solution of bichloride of mercury (1:500). They
should then be rinsed in warm water and preserved in a
3 per cent. watery solution of carbolic acid, which should
be changed every week.</p>

<p>Artificial sponges, or gauze sponges, are the most convenient
in abdominal surgery. They are cheap, and may
be destroyed after each operation, and they are very
easily and certainly sterilized in the steam sterilizer.
Good marine sponges are so expensive that but few operators
destroy them after they have been once used. The
cleansing and sterilization of such sponges are tedious
and uncertain. The gauze sponges answer every purpose.</p>

<p>The gauze sponges may be made of various sizes by
sewing together about eighteen layers of plain absorbent
gauze. The edges of the gauze should be folded in and
hemmed to prevent the escape of loose threads in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
peritoneum. Some operators use sponges made by wrapping
absorbent cotton somewhat loosely in gauze.</p>

<p>The number of sponges used should always be recorded
before the operation. It is advisable to preserve the
sponges in sets always of the same number, so that in
every case the operator knows that this number, or some
multiple of this number, of sponges has been used. The
writer uses such sets of seven gauze sponges of the following
sizes: one sponge 3 by 3 inches; one sponge 10
by 7 inches; five sponges 5 by 5 inches. Usually one
such set of sponges is enough for an abdominal operation.
In some cases, however, the first set of sponges
may become soiled by the discharge from an abscess or a
suppurating tumor, and it is advisable to discard these
sponges and to complete the operation with a second
clean set.</p>

<p>The number of sponges should never be altered during
an operation by cutting one in two.</p>

<p>Sponges should never be removed from the operating-room
until the abdomen has been closed and the sponges
have been counted. If a sponge falls on the floor or in
the vessel to receive slops, it should be put aside until
the final counting is completed.</p>

<p>When a set of sponges is used, they should always be
carefully counted as they are placed in the basin, for the
nurse who prepared and put up the set may have carelessly
miscounted them.</p>

<p>Accuracy in regard to the sponges is of the greatest
importance. There are a number of recorded cases, and
many unrecorded, in which sponges have been left in
the abdomen. This accident is usually fatal, though
there are several cases on record in which the sponge has
made its way, by ulceration, into the intestine, and has
been discharged from the anus, or has been removed by
subsequent incision through the abdominal wall.</p>

<p><b id="DISCIPLINE_OF_THE_OPERATING_ROOM">Discipline of the Operating-room.</b>&mdash;The discipline
of the operating-room should be most rigid. Perfect
personal asepsis can be obtained only by continuous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
watching and criticism. The work should be systematically
divided among the assistants and nurses, and
each should attend strictly to his or her own department,
and to nothing else.</p>

<p>The first assistant should assist the operator with
sponges, etc. The second assistant should attend to the
instruments, ligatures, and sutures. The first nurse
should wash the sponges and place them in a basin of
sterile water beside the first assistant. She should also
attend to the towels and dressings. The second nurse,
under direction of the first, should change soiled water
in the sponge- and hand-basins, etc.</p>

<p>No one should pick up anything that may have been
dropped upon the floor, and no one, unless it is absolutely
necessary, should touch anything that has not
been sterilized.</p>

<p><b id="ANESTHESIA">Anesthesia.</b>&mdash;With the exception of the operator, the
anesthetizer is the most important person at an abdominal
operation. A careful, experienced anesthetizer is
desirable in all operations, but especially so in an abdominal
operation. Much more depends upon him than upon
the assistant. The custom of trusting the anesthesia to
the least experienced man is reprehensible. Many fatal
cases after celiotomy may be attributed directly to the
anesthesia.</p>

<p>Every operator of experience has observed the difference
in reaction between those patients who have been
carefully anesthetized and those who have been improperly
anesthetized. In a serious case attended by unavoidable
shock the superadded depression of ether-poisoning
may be enough to cause a fatal result.</p>

<p>The operator should have nothing to do with the anesthesia,
and it should not be necessary for him to watch it.
The anesthetizer should make a careful examination of
the heart, and should be provided with a hypodermic
syringe and the necessary stimulants, which he should
use at his own discretion.</p>

<p>He should, of course, use the minimum amount of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
ether. He should be familiar with the steps of the operation,
and he should so regulate the anesthesia that the
operator will not be impeded by the straining or struggles
of the patient at critical moments.</p>

<p><b id="PREPARATION_OF_THE_PATIENT">Preparation of the Patient.</b>&mdash;It is always desirable,
when possible, to have the patient under observation for
several days before operation. As I have already said, a
more accurate diagnosis may be made by repeated examinations,
and opportunity is afforded for the administration
of medicines to improve the general condition. A
weak woman about to submit to a serious operation is
benefited by the administration of 1/20 grain of strychnine
three times a day, for several days before the operation.</p>

<p>During this period the patient should receive a daily
bath, a laxative when necessary to produce a daily movement,
and a vaginal douche of one gallon of hot water
every morning and evening.</p>

<p>The special preparation of the patient is directed to
sterilizing the abdominal surface, the external genitals,
and the vagina, and to emptying the gastro-intestinal
tract. This preparation should begin twenty-four hours
before the operation. During this time it is best to confine
the patient to bed.</p>

<p>Thorough evacuation of the intestinal tract is very desirable
in abdominal surgery. When the intestines are
empty and collapsed, the various intra-abdominal manipulations
are most easily performed. If the intestine is
injured and it becomes necessary to repair it, or if any
other intestinal operation is required, it may be performed
most easily and with the greatest cleanliness if the gut is
empty.</p>

<p>Though it is impossible to sterilize the intestinal tract,
yet we most nearly approach the condition of sterilization
by thorough evacuation of the bowels.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours before the operation purgation
should be begun by the administration of 1 dram of
Rochelle salts, dissolved in half a tumblerful of water
or soda-water, every hour until the bowels begin to move
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
freely. Five or six doses are usually sufficient. The
lower bowel should finally be emptied thoroughly by an
enema of soap and water administered three or four hours
before operation. During the twenty-four hours preceding
operation the diet should consist of light, easily
digested, concentrated nourishment, such as milk, buttermilk,
soft-boiled eggs, rare beef, soups, beef-tea, coffee,
tea, and whiskey if necessary.</p>

<p>Unless the patient is very weak, no food should be
given on the morning of the operation. If her condition
does not warrant such abstinence, she may have a
glass of milk, buttermilk, coffee, or milk-punch. Such
food is required if the operation is performed late in the
day.</p>

<p>In very feeble patients a nutrient enema may be administered
about two hours before the operation.</p>

<p>A hypodermic injection of 1/20 grain of strychnine is
often useful upon the morning of the operation when the
patient is in poor condition.</p>

<p><i>Preparation of the External Genitals and Vagina.</i>&mdash;The
pubis and the external genitals should be shaved.
The woman should be drawn down to the edge of the bed,
and the anus, the external genitals, and the vagina
should be scrubbed with green soap. The vagina should
be washed throughout. The nurse may do this by inserting
one or two fingers, or she may retract the perineum
with the Sims speculum, and scrub the vagina,
the fornices, and the vaginal cervix with cotton held in
forceps.</p>

<p>The scrubbing should be followed by a vaginal douche
of a gallon of hot water to wash out the soap, and then
by a douche of two quarts of bichloride solution (1:2000).
One hour before operation the vaginal douche of bichloride
should be repeated, and the nurse should introduce
in the vagina as far as the cervix a light vaginal
tampon of gauze wet with the bichlorid solution. In
every abdominal operation on women it is desirable that
the external genitals and the vagina should be clean. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
may be necessary to pass the catheter or to perform some
vaginal manipulation, or the vagina may be opened during
the operation.</p>

<p>If the vagina is small or virginal, or if the woman is
nervous, the nurse may be unable to perform the method
of cleansing just described; and it is then necessary for
the operator or the assistant to clean the vagina after the
woman is anesthetized. Such cleansing should always
be performed, in addition to the cleansing by the nurse,
whenever a vaginal operation is performed or it is expected
that the vagina will be opened from above.
Thorough vaginal sterilization is most easily accomplished
when the patient is under the influence of ether,
as the perineum is easily retracted and the vagina becomes
more patulous. The woman should be placed in
the lithotomy position, and the washing should be performed
with two fingers or with a soft brush like a
jeweller’s brush, or with cotton in forceps. If necessary,
the perineum should be retracted with the speculum.
Green soap should be used, and the vaginal walls,
the fornices, and the cervix should be thoroughly scrubbed.
The soap should then be carefully washed out, and
the scrubbing should be repeated with bichloride-of-mercury
solution (1:2000).</p>

<p>The cleansing of the external genitals and the vagina
is best done by the nurse after the final movement of the
bowels and immediately before the woman has her general
bath.</p>

<p><i>Sterilization of the Abdomen.</i>&mdash;The patient should have
a warm bath from head to feet upon the morning of the
operation. The abdomen, from the ensiform cartilage
to the pubis, should be scrubbed with a nail-brush.
Special care should be devoted to cleansing the umbilicus.
After this bath the patient should be dressed in a
clean flannel undershirt and night-gown and should be
placed in a clean bed.</p>

<p>The nurse should then wash the abdomen, from the
ensiform cartilage to the pubis and from flank to flank,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
and the upper third of the anterior aspect of the thighs,
first with turpentine, second with green soap, and finally
with ether, devoting special care to the umbilicus. The
abdomen should then be covered with a large wet bichloride
dressing (1:2000), which should not be removed
until the patient is upon the operating-table. A towel
wrung out of the bichloride solution and held in place by
a bandage or binder will answer the purpose. A second
cleansing of the abdomen by the operator or the assistant
should be done after the patient is upon the table. The
surface should be washed with green soap and sterile
water, then with ether, and finally with the solution of
bichloride of mercury. The washing should not be restricted
to the central abdomen, but should extend over
the upper parts of the thighs and the flanks, which may
be exposed during the operation.</p>

<p>The bladder should be emptied by the catheter immediately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
before the patient is placed upon the operating-table.</p>

<p>The patient should be placed upon the operating-table
by clean nurses or assistants.</p>

<p>The legs should be strapped to the table. The hands
should be held out of the way by the anesthetizer. They
may be retained very well by a safety-pin passed through
the lower sleeve and the shoulder of the night-gown or
the pillow-case.</p>

<p>The undershirt and night-gown should be drawn well
up behind, to prevent wetting. If the clothes become
wet, they should be changed immediately after operation.</p>

<p>The legs and the chest should be covered with clean
blankets. The field of operation should be surrounded by
sterilized towels. One large towel with a hole of suitable
size in the center is convenient. A pocket may be made
immediately below the hole, to retain the instruments
when the Trendelenburg position is employed.</p>

<p>Three sizes of twisted silk are used for suture and ligature:
heavy silk for ligature of the large arteries; medium
silk for ligature of smaller vessels and for various suturing
in the abdomen; fine silk for peritoneal and intestinal
suture.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_198" src="images/fig_198.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 198.</span>&mdash;Pedicle-needle.</p></div>

<p>The silk should be as small as is consistent with secure
ligature. The heavy silk is necessary for the ligature of
pedicles in which a large amount of surrounding tissue
is included with the artery.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_199" src="images/fig_199.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 199.</span>&mdash;Small curved trocar.</p></div>

<p>The silk is rolled on glass spools or on cores of gauze,
contained in glass tubes plugged with cotton, and is then
sterilized in the steam sterilizer by fractional sterilization.
It is advisable always to use, for heavy ligature,
silk of a uniform size, because the operator becomes
accustomed to the strength of the silk and knows just
how much strain it will bear. Silkworm-gut is the best
material to use for suture of the abdominal incision in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
case the “through-and-through” or interrupted mass-suture
is employed.</p>

<p>The silkworm-gut should be of the heaviest and the
longest size. It may be sterilized by boiling with the
instruments before the operation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_200" src="images/fig_200.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 200.</span>&mdash;Large cyst-trocar.</p></div>

<p><i>Catgut</i> is sometimes employed for ligature and suture.
The difficulty of securing certain sterilization makes it
advisable to avoid using this material within the peritoneal
cavity. Sterilized silk is so certainly absorbed in
all cases and is so easily employed that the writer has
altogether given up the use of catgut within the peritoneum.
It is useful as a buried suture for the muscle
and fascia of the abdominal wall. Silk is not so certainly
absorbed in this position, and if the catgut should
happen to be imperfectly sterilized, no worse result than
suppuration of the incision will occur.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_201" src="images/fig_201.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 201.</span>&mdash;Reiner’s needle-holder.</p></div>

<p>Various methods of sterilizing catgut have been introduced.
The writer uses the following method, which
bacteriological experiments and clinical experience have
shown to be good: The catgut is soaked in juniper oil
for one week. The oil is then washed out with ether
and the catgut is soaked in ether for forty-eight hours.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
The gut is then rolled on glass spools and is placed in a
glass jar containing pure alcohol. The alcohol is boiled
in the jar for an hour at a time on several successive days.
The gut is used directly from this jar, and is always
boiled in the alcohol for an hour before each operation.
In this way, if a considerable amount of gut is prepared
at one time, it is subjected to many boilings before it is
used up. The alcohol is boiled by placing the glass jar
in a vessel of hot water.</p>

<p>The following methods of sterilizing catgut are also
good:</p>

<p><i>The Claudius or Iodin Method for the Sterilization of
Catgut.</i>&mdash;Cut the catgut into the desired lengths and wind
on glass slides or spools. Place in a wide-mouth jar with
a glass stopper containing a solution composed of iodin
and potassium iodide, each one part, and distilled water
100 parts. In making this solution the iodin and potassium
iodide should first be pulverized in a mortar, the distilled
water should be added, and stirred with the pestle
until solution is complete.</p>

<p>At the end of eight days the catgut is sterile and ready
for use. It may be kept indefinitely in the solution without
deterioration. Before using take the catgut from the
jar with sterile forceps and rinse in sterile water.</p>

<p><i>The Cumol Method for the Sterilization of Catgut, employed
at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.</i>&mdash;1. Cut the catgut
into the desired lengths, and roll 12 strands in a figure-of-8
form, so that it may be slipped into a large test-tube.</p>

<p>2. Bring the catgut gradually up to a temperature of
80° C., and hold it at this point for one hour.</p>

<p>3. Place the catgut in cumol, which must not be above
a temperature of 100° C., raise it to 165° C., and hold it
at this point for one hour.</p>

<p>4. Pour off the cumol, and either allow the heat of the
sand-bath to dry the catgut, or transfer it to a hot-air
oven, at a temperature of 100° C. for two hours.</p>

<p>5. Transfer the rings with sterile forceps to test-tubes
previously sterilized as in the laboratory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span></p>

<p>The cleanest specimens of the crude catgut should be
obtained for surgical purposes. There is no doubt that
some specimens of crude catgut are more difficult to
sterilize than others. A special apparatus has been introduced
for sterilizing catgut which renders the process
safe and certain.</p>

<p>The writer uses catgut only for suture of the abdominal
fascia and muscles. Large-sized gut is employed.</p>

<p><b id="THE_DRESSING">The Dressing.</b>&mdash;The dressing of the abdominal wound
consists of ten or twelve layers of sterilized gauze, covered
by a large sterilized abdominal pad about 1 inch
thick, 13 inches long, and 9 inches broad. The pad is
made of absorbent cotton enclosed in a layer of gauze.
The dressing is retained in place by a six-tailed sterilized
abdominal binder of flannel.</p>

<p>If no drainage through the abdominal incision is employed,
the use of celloidin with the gauze dressing is of
advantage. It retains the dressing securely in position
for an indefinite period, and, if used liberally, it acts as a
splint for the abdominal wall. Either of the two following
formulæ given by Robb may be used:</p>

<table class="list">

<h3 id="THE_TECHNIQUE_OF_GYNECOLOGICAL_OPERATIONS_CONTINUED">THE TECHNIQUE OF GYNECOLOGICAL OPERATIONS (Continued).</h3>

<p><span id="ABDOMINAL_DRAINAGE" class="smcap">Abdominal Drainage.</span>&mdash;Drainage of the peritoneum
is accomplished by means of the glass drainage-tube (<a href="#fig_202">Fig.
202</a>), or by capillary drainage with gauze. The peritoneum
may be drained through the abdominal incision or
through the vagina. On account of the difficulty of
keeping the vagina sterile, drainage through the abdominal
incision is the safer method. Vaginal drainage is
preferred when the operation is performed through the
vagina and no abdominal incision is made, as in the operation
of vaginal hysterectomy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_202" src="images/fig_202.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 202.</span>&mdash;Glass drainage-tube.</p></div>

<p>The glass drainage-tubes should be of various lengths&mdash;5
to 7 inches. The outer diameter should be about ⅜
or ½ inch. The lower portion of the tube is perforated
with small holes over a distance of about 1½ inches.
Around the upper part or neck of the tube, which protrudes
from the abdomen, is placed a square of rubber
dam, such as is used by dentists, about 8 by 8 inches in
size. The tube passes through a hole in the center of the
rubber. The tube and the rubber dam may be sterilized
by boiling. The tube is usually placed in the lower angle
of the abdominal incision, and the abdominal dressing is
split so that it may be placed around the tube. The
bandage is applied so that the four upper tails pass above
the tube and the two lower tails pass below it. The
opening of the tube and the rubber dam are outside of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
the bandage. When the dressing and bandage have been
applied, the opening of the tube is plugged with sterile
absorbent cotton, and a handful of cotton is placed in the
dam, which is then folded over and pinned. A sterile
towel is placed over the dam. Some operators insert a
cord of cotton or a few narrow strips of gauze to the
bottom of the tube, in order to maintain a continuous
capillary drain.</p>

<p>Cleansing or emptying the drainage-tube is a procedure
which should be very carefully attended to. Strict asepsis
should be observed in all the manipulations. For the
first few hours the general peritoneum is exposed to danger
of infection every time the tube is opened. After
the first twenty-four hours, though the danger of general
peritoneal infection is remote or absent, yet there is
always danger of local infection of the tube-tract. Such
local infection may result in a persistent sinus or other
complication. A ligature near to or in contact with the
tube may become infected, and the sinus will remain
open until the ligature is discharged.</p>

<p>The tube may be cleaned by any careful nurse. The
bedclothes should be drawn down to the pubis and the
clothing should be drawn up, so that the abdomen is exposed.
Sterile towels should be placed about the rubber
dam. The hands of the nurse should be sterilized. The
dam should be opened, the cotton should be removed,
and the orifice of the tube exposed. The tube should
be emptied with the long-nozzled syringe (<a href="#fig_203">Fig. 203</a>), or
with some other easily sterilized apparatus by which the
fluid may be withdrawn.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_203" src="images/fig_203.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 203.</span>&mdash;Syringe for cleaning drainage-tube.</p></div>

<p>All fluid should be withdrawn from the drainage-tube.
The dam should be carefully cleansed by wiping with
cotton wet with the solution of bichlorid of mercury.
A fresh cotton plug should be inserted in the tube, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
the dam should be folded and pinned over a handful of
cotton. The whole should then be covered with a sterile
towel.</p>

<p>The tube should be emptied or cleaned as often as it
becomes filled. It is often necessary at first to clean it
every fifteen, thirty, or sixty minutes. If free bleeding
is taking place, it is most quickly arrested by frequent
cleaning of the tube. Unless the nurse is experienced,
the operator or assistant should watch the drainage-tube
for the first hour after operation, in order to direct
the nurse in regard to the required frequency of
cleansing. A record should be kept of the amount of
fluid withdrawn.</p>

<p>The intervals between cleansings are gradually increased
until once every six or twelve hours becomes sufficient.
It is not often necessary to keep the tube in the
abdomen longer than two or three days.</p>

<p>The tube should be removed when the fluid discharged
becomes serous in character and small in amount&mdash;about
one dram every four or five hours. Before removing the
tube the flannel binder should be opened and the wound
should be exposed. When the glass tube is withdrawn,
it is best to replace it by a small rubber tube. This may
be done by inserting the rubber tube to the bottom of the
glass tube, which is then withdrawn. If we were certain
that the tube-tract were aseptic, the introduction of the
rubber tube would be unnecessary, and we might close
the lower angle of the incision immediately by suture.
This procedure, however, may be followed by fluid-accumulation
and the formation of abscess in the tube-tract.
It is therefore safest always to use the rubber tube. The
rubber tube should be withdrawn gradually, an inch or two
every day, so that the tract will close from the bottom.
In order to prevent the rubber tube slipping altogether
into the drainage-tract, it is advisable to insert a small
safety-pin through the extra-abdominal end. The end of
the rubber tube should be surrounded and covered by
several layers of gauze and the abdominal pad.</p>

<p><b id="GAUZE_DRAINAGE">Gauze-drainage.</b>&mdash;Capillary drainage with gauze is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
sometimes more convenient than drainage with the tube.
A strip, about 2 inches in width, of several layers of
gauze should be carried, from the part of the pelvis to be
drained, out through the lower angle of the abdominal
incision. When the sutures are introduced the lower
angle of the incision should not be too tightly closed,
or drainage will be impeded. The extra-abdominal end
of the gauze drain should be surrounded and covered by
several layers of loosely-packed gauze and by the abdominal
pad and binder. Sterile cotton should be tucked
under the binder immediately above the pubis, and, if
necessary, around the upper and lateral margins of the
pad. The dressing need not be disturbed for one, two,
or three days, unless the discharge has soaked through
the abdominal binder.</p>

<p>A convenient capillary drain is made of a gauze bag
containing several strips of gauze.</p>

<p>One objection to the gauze drain is the difficulty of removal.
Lymph-processes and granulations penetrate the
interstices of the gauze, and often render its removal very
difficult. The surgeon fears to use too much force in attempts
at withdrawal, because an adherent loop of intestine
or the omentum may be pulled out of place or damaged,
or the lymph-wall of the drainage-tract may become
opened and expose the general peritoneum to infection.
To avoid this difficulty the writer has for some time employed
a drain made by surrounding the gauze bag with
an ordinary rubber condom the end of which has been
cut open (<a href="#fig_204">Fig. 204</a>). With this arrangement the surgeon
may feel certain that there are no adhesions except at the
end of the drain. Such drains may be removed as easily
as the glass tube. The condom may be sterilized by boiling.
Gauze drains should be removed at the end of two
or three days. After withdrawing the gauze it is advisable
to insert a small rubber tube, for reasons that have
been mentioned in considering the use of the glass drainage-tube.</p>

<p>The gauze drain may be used in all cases except when
it is necessary to drain pus or some solid material like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
feces. In such cases the glass tube should be employed,
either alone or surrounded by a gauze pack to protect the
general peritoneum.</p>

<p>In pelvic surgery the drain, whether glass or gauze,
should, as a rule, be placed at the most dependent part
of the pelvis, which is the bottom of Douglas’s pouch.
It may be placed to either side of the median line in case
the chief discharge is expected to take place from this
position. Hemorrhage from a bleeding surface deep in
the pelvis may often be controlled by the direct pressure
of the end of the gauze drain placed over it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_204" src="images/fig_204.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 204.</span>&mdash;Gauze drain with rubber cover.</p></div>

<p>The drain should be introduced immediately before the
abdominal sutures are tied.</p>

<p><b id="INDICATIONS_FOR_DRAINAGE">Indications for Drainage.</b>&mdash;Great diversity of practice
exists among operators as to the use of drainage
after celiotomy, and a decided change has taken place in
regard to drainage during the past twenty years. In the
early days of modern abdominal surgery drainage was
used very much more than it is at present; some of the
best operators used it in the majority of their cases; now
a number of operators never use drainage after celiotomy,
while others use it only when specially indicated. Much
depends upon the individual methods of the operator.
The operator who is careless in his asepsis and hemostasis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
should use drainage oftener than he who is careful in
these particulars. The advice, “When in doubt drain,”
is very good; but the surgeon should strive to eliminate
the element of doubt as much as possible, and to have a
definite reason for all his procedures. If drainage is not
necessary, it is harmful. It necessitates more frequent
dressings and disturbance of the patient, and it prevents
perfect closure of the abdominal incision.</p>

<p>The object of drainage is the removal from the peritoneum
of discharges which are, or which may become,
septic or dangerous. Such discharges are blood, pus,
serum, cyst-contents, and ascitic fluid.</p>

<p>Even though the peritoneum be dry and all bleeding
be arrested when the operation is completed, yet it must
be remembered that a subsequent free serous exudation
will take place if the peritoneum has been exposed or
subjected to chemical or mechanical irritation.</p>

<p>Infection may take place from imperfect asepsis at the
time of operation; or it may be caused by the escape into
the peritoneum of septic material which existed in the
abdomen before the operation; or it may occur subsequently,
from the passage of septic organisms from the
interior of the intestine through the intestinal wall.</p>

<p>The absorbing power of the healthy peritoneum is so
great that a large amount of fluid (even though not absolutely
sterile) may be taken up by it. Injury of the peritoneum
from exposure or other irritation not only increases
the amount of fluid to be absorbed, but it
diminishes the power of absorption; and injury of the
intestinal peritoneum or of the wall of the intestine favors
the passage of septic organisms through it.</p>

<p>The operator should bear these facts in mind when he
considers the subject of drainage.</p>

<p>A certain amount of absorption of blood or other sterile
fluid may be trusted to the peritoneum.</p>

<p>It is sometimes impossible to arrest all venous oozing
from raw surfaces, and the blood must be left for absorption
by the peritoneum, or must be carried off by drainage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
with the glass tube or with gauze. Drainage enables
the operator to watch the amount of hemorrhage after
operations, so that if excessive he may employ measures
to check it. Drainage also acts as a hemostatic. The
direct pressure of the gauze upon the bleeding area
checks the hemorrhage, and the continual removal of
blood, the promotion of dryness, and the contact of air
through the glass tube have a decided hemostatic effect.</p>

<p>Drainage, therefore, is sometimes used not only to remove
blood, but to aid in arresting hemorrhage. As the
operator becomes more experienced he practises more perfect
hemostasis, and learns to obliterate by buried suture,
to fold in, or to cover with peritoneum raw bleeding surfaces,
so that drainage as a means of hemostasis is less
often required. If the operator fears that the peritoneum
has become infected from imperfect asepsis at the operation,
or from the escape into it of some septic material
like pus, he should employ drainage, especially if he
expects much subsequent serous or bloody discharge to
take place.</p>

<p>If the intestinal wall has been extensively injured, as
we sometimes find after an adherent intestine has been
liberated, drainage should be employed; for septic organisms
most readily pass through such an injured wall, and
the damage may be so great that necrosis may take place,
with the escape of intestinal contents. It must be remembered
that all purulent accumulations in the abdomen
and pelvis are not septic. Such accumulations
were septic in the beginning, but in the majority of
chronic cases the septic organisms have died and disappeared,
and the pus is perfectly sterile and harmless to
the peritoneum. Consequently, if an ovarian or a tubal
abscess ruptures during removal, and the contents escape
into the peritoneum, drainage is not necessarily required.
For a period of three years the writer had in such
cases immediate bacteriological examination of the pus
made, and determined drainage from the result of
such examination. In the majority of cases the pus was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
sterile and drainage was not employed. It has been
found, as would be expected, that the pus is most often
septic in the cases of recent suppuration and in the
chronic cases during an acute attack. Experience also
teaches that suppurating dermoids are very likely to be
septic.</p>

<p>It will be seen from these considerations that in determining
the question of drainage much must be left to the
judgment and the experience of the operator.</p>

<p>If an aseptic operation has been performed, and there
is no intestinal lesion and hemostasis is perfect, drainage
is not required. This condition of things is, of course,
most often attained by the experienced operator. If the
operator fears septic infection for any reason, or fears that
the hemostasis is not good, he should employ drainage.
At the present day the decided majority of the best operators
use abdominal drainage very little.</p>

<p>When general peritoneal sepsis exists before the abdomen
is opened, drainage is always indicated.</p>

<p><b id="VAGINAL_DRAINAGE">Vaginal Drainage.</b>&mdash;Drainage of the peritoneum
through the vagina is usually accomplished by making
an opening through Douglas’s pouch into the posterior
vaginal fornix. A rubber drainage-tube or a gauze drain
may then be inserted. The vagina and vulva should,
of course, have been thoroughly sterilized. The vagina
should be lightly packed with gauze, and the vulva should
be protected by a gauze and cotton dressing. As has
been said, the chief objection to vaginal drainage of the
peritoneum is the difficulty of sterilizing and maintaining
sterile the vagina and the vulva.</p>

<p><b id="THE_INCISION_OF_THE_ABDOMINAL_WALL">The Incision of the Abdominal Wall.</b>&mdash;The various
abdominal operations of gynecology are performed
through an incision in the median line. The position of
the incision depends upon the condition to be treated.
The incision for performing ventro-suspension of the
uterus is made near to the symphysis pubis. The incision
for the removal of a large cyst is made at a higher
point. As a rule, the incision, about 2 or 2½ inches in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
length, should be made about midway between the umbilicus
and the pubis, and should be extended upward or
downward as necessary. The incision should be as small
as the operator can conveniently work through. He
should not hesitate to enlarge the incision to facilitate
any manipulations. The length will depend a good deal
upon the thickness of the abdominal walls.</p>

<p>The structures that are incised are the skin, the subcutaneous
fat, the parietal fascia, the linea alba or the
edge of the rectus muscle, the subperitoneal fat, and the
peritoneum.</p>

<p>If the incision is made exactly in the median line, the
linea alba will be divided and the sheath of the rectus
will not be opened. This is most usual in multiparous
women with lax abdominal walls and widely separated
recti muscles, and in cases in which the abdomen is distended
by a tumor. If the sheath of the rectus is opened,
the muscle will be exposed, and the linea alba should
be sought on the side upon which the fascia fails to
retract.</p>

<p>If the linea alba cannot readily be found, the incision
should be carried directly through the muscle. Some
operators consider it an advantage, in obtaining subsequent
firm union, to expose the muscle in this way.
When the subperitoneal fat is reached, it should be torn
and pushed aside with the blunt closed forceps or with the
fingers.</p>

<p>The peritoneum should be caught with forceps and
drawn forward. The assistant should catch the peritoneum
with a second pair of forceps at a point about ⅓ or
½ inch to the side of the first pair, and the small fold
of peritoneum thus produced should be incised with the
knife. As soon as the smallest opening is made in the
peritoneum the air rushes in and the intestines and omentum
fall back. The opening is then enlarged with the
knife or scissors.</p>

<p>The greatest care must be exercised in those cases in
which the omentum or the intestines are adherent to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
anterior abdominal wall. The experienced operator usually
observes indications of such a condition as soon as
he has passed through the linea alba. The tissues are
more rigid and unyielding than normal, and the peritoneum
cannot be readily picked up with the forceps. In
such cases the operator should proceed very slowly, and
if necessary should enlarge the outer incision and enter
the peritoneum at a point above or below the area of
adhesion.</p>

<p><b id="EXPLORATION_OF_THE_ABDOMEN">Exploration of the Abdomen.</b>&mdash;Having opened the
peritoneum, the operator should insert two fingers (the
middle and the index finger of the left hand) and should
carefully examine the condition to be treated.</p>

<p>If necessary, he should retract the edges of the incision,
and should place the patient in the Trendelenburg position,
in order to make an ocular examination.</p>

<p>It is always advisable to make a preliminary investigation
of this kind before proceeding with the operation.
In this way the diagnosis will be corrected and complications
which must be treated will be determined. It may
be found that what was thought to be a cyst is in reality
a uterine fibroid or perhaps a normal pregnancy; or the
surgeon may discover a hopeless condition, such as extensive
cancer or peritoneal papilloma, for which further
operation will be useless.</p>

<p><b id="PROTECTION_OF_THE_INTESTINES_AND_OMENTUM">Protection of the Intestines and Omentum.</b>&mdash;During
all manipulations within the abdomen the peritoneum,
intestines, and omentum should be handled most
gently. Injury of the peritoneum increases the danger
of shock, sepsis, and intestinal adhesions. The intestines
should never be allowed to protrude through the
abdominal incision unless it is necessary for the performance
of the operation. Such a necessity rarely, if ever,
arises in gynecological operations. All the intestines
may be removed from the field of operation&mdash;the pelvis&mdash;by
placing the woman in the Trendelenburg position.
Protrusion of intestines through the abdominal incision
should be prevented by using large gauze pads or sponges.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
It is advisable always to surround the field of operation
by a wall of gauze pads. They protect the intestines
and prevent the escape of fluids into the upper peritoneum.
This precaution is especially desirable when the
Trendelenburg position is used, to prevent fluids from
the pelvis escaping into the upper abdomen. The pads
should be introduced after being wrung out of warm
water, and should be replaced by fresh warm pads as soon
as they become saturated with fluid. If they become
soiled by pus or other septic fluid, it is safest to discard
them for the remainder of the operation.</p>

<p><b id="TOILET_OF_THE_PERITONEUM">Toilet of the Peritoneum.</b>&mdash;The field of operation,
and, if necessary, the general peritoneum, should always
be cleaned and dried before the abdominal incision is
closed. This is done by sponging and by irrigation with
warm sterile water or with normal salt-solution. The
sponging should be performed with great gentleness, to
avoid peritoneal irritation. There are several regions
in which fluids and blood-clots are most likely to collect,
and which therefore demand especial inspection.</p>

<p>The chief of these regions is the hollow of the sacrum,
or Douglas’s pouch. Fluids also collect on the anterior
surface of the broad ligaments and in the renal hollows.</p>

<p>If but little fluid has escaped into the abdomen, and
the field of operation has been confined to the pelvis, we
need look for accumulations of fluid and blood only in
Douglas’s pouch and in front of the broad ligaments.
If the upper portion of the abdomen has been invaded,
it is advisable to inspect the renal hollows.
Blood-clot and fluid may be readily removed by the
sponge held in the fingers or in forceps.</p>

<p>Irrigation of the peritoneum is not often required. It
is not necessary to flood the peritoneum with water in
order to wash out blood-clot, which may be removed with
more accuracy by sponging. There is always danger,
in general irrigation of the peritoneum, of spreading infection.</p>

<p>Local washing of the pelvis is sometimes advisable if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
the operator fears that the field of operation has been infected
by the escape of septic material. Such a condition
may exist in operations for tubal or ovarian abscess.
The upper peritoneum should be first shut off from the
pelvic cavity with a wall of gauze sponges. This may
be readily done while the patient is in the Trendelenburg
position. She should then be placed in the horizontal
position, while the operator, with the left hand pressed
against the wall of pads, prevents the intestines entering
the pelvis. The abdominal incision should be held open
with retractors, and the sterile irrigating fluid should be
poured in from a flask or a pitcher. The temperature
of the fluid should be 100°-115° F. The fluid may be
removed by sponging, and washing may be repeated as
often as necessary.</p>

<p>In septic cases the writer has frequently performed such
local washing with a bichloride solution (1:2000 or 1:4000),
followed by irrigation with plain water.</p>

<p>If the patient is horizontal and the gauze pads be
properly placed, there is no danger of any of the fluid
entering the upper peritoneal cavity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_205" src="images/fig_205.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 205.</span>&mdash;The mass-suture for closing the abdominal incision: <i>S</i>, skin; <i>F</i>,
fascia; <i>M</i>, muscle; <i>P</i>, peritoneum.</p></div>

<p><b id="CLOSING_THE_ABDOMINAL_INCISION">Closing the Abdominal Incision.</b>&mdash;A variety of
methods have been introduced for closing the abdominal
incision. The simplest method, that is applicable to all
cases, is the interrupted mass-suture, or the “through-and-through”
suture. This suture passes through all
the structures of the abdominal wall (<a href="#fig_205">Fig. 205</a>). Some
operators advise passing the suture to, but not through,
the peritoneum. The writer includes the edge of the
peritoneum in the suture. These sutures should be placed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
two or three to the inch, according to the thickness of
the abdominal wall.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to include all the structures in
the embrace of the suture. A carelessly applied suture
sometimes fails to include the retracted fascia and muscle.
The needle should first be directed outward and then inward
as it passes through the abdominal wall. It should
not pass directly through, parallel to the sagittal plane
of the incision. Thus when the suture is tied it forms
approximately a circle, and the structures included in
it are brought into a plane of apposition.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_206" src="images/fig_206.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 206.</span>&mdash;The subcuticular or
intra-cutaneous suture. The fascia
has been united by an interrupted
suture.</p></div>

<p>A long straight needle with a spear-point is convenient
for introducing the mass-suture. A gauze sponge
should be placed beneath the
incision as the sutures are
introduced, to prevent injury
of the intestines and the escape
of blood into the peritoneum.
When the pad is removed, the
omentum, if readily found,
should be drawn down behind
the incision. Before each
suture is secured the sides of
the incision should be drawn
forward by traction on the
ends of the suture, to ensure
accurate apposition upon the
posterior or peritoneal aspect.
If this precaution is not taken,
in a thick or rigid abdominal
wall the cutaneous aspect of
the incision may be brought
into accurate apposition, while
a gap will exist between the
more posterior structures. Such imperfect apposition is
a frequent cause of ventral hernia. The mass-sutures
should not be removed for two weeks. The early removal
of sterile sutures is of no advantage whatever, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
may cause ventral hernia. The writer often leaves them
in for three weeks.</p>

<p>After the sutures are removed the incision should be
strapped with adhesive plaster.</p>

<p>The application of a buried suture of catgut or of
silver wire, passed through the muscle and fascia, is a
useful addition to the mass-suture and an additional preventive
of hernia.</p>

<p>Various methods of uniting the tissues by sutures in
separate layers are used. A very good method is to close
the peritoneum by a continuous suture of fine silk, then
to unite the muscle and fascia by a continuous suture of
catgut, and finally to close the cutaneous edge with an
interrupted or a continuous suture of silkworm gut or
silk. The subcuticular or the intra-cutaneous suture
(<a href="#fig_206">Fig. 206</a>) is very convenient for this purpose.</p>

<p>If the abdominal wall be fat, it is advisable to introduce
a second catgut suture through the subcutaneous fat.
When the structures are united in layers, a hematoma
sometimes forms between two planes of suture, and, if
not absorbed, the anterior portion of the wound may
break down. This accident, which is caused by hemorrhage
after the sutures are secured, may be prevented
by employing, in addition to the usual dressing, a compress
of gauze placed over the incision.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<h3 id="TREATMENT_AFTER_CELIOTOMY">TREATMENT AFTER CELIOTOMY.</h3>

<p>The after-treatment of celiotomy is usually very simple.
A special nurse is required for the first three days. The
patient should lie upon her back for the first two or three
days; after this she may be moved partly upon either
side, and a pillow may be placed behind her for support.</p>

<p>The head may be supported by one or two pillows.
Much comfort is experienced by raising the knees over
pillows. The patient often complains bitterly of backache,
which may be relieved by slipping a folded sheet or
towel under the small of the back.</p>

<p>Thirst is always present after celiotomy, and is usually
the symptom of which the patient complains the most.
There is much diversity of practice in regard to the administration
of water after celiotomy. The writer allows
no water during the first twenty-four hours. During this
time the lips and mouth are frequently moistened with
a cloth wet in cold water or wrapped about a piece of ice.
At the end of twenty-four hours small quantities of hot
water or cold soda-water (1 dram) are given every fifteen
minutes or half hour, and gradually increased as it is
found to be retained by the stomach. Hot water relieves
thirst as well, and is not so likely to cause vomiting, as
cold water.</p>

<p>The chief objection to the early administration of water
after celiotomy is that it may cause vomiting. Some
operators avoid this by administering the water by the
rectum.</p>

<p>Another reason, more or less theoretical, for withholding
water is that the absorbing power of the peritoneum
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
is greatest when the tissues of the body contain a deficient
amount of water.</p>

<p>Pain after celiotomy seems to bear no relation whatever
to the amount of traumatism that has been inflicted.
More discomfort may be experienced after ventro-suspension
of the uterus than after a hysterectomy. In operations
upon the generative organs the chief seat of pain is
in the region of the sacrum. Pain is also felt in the ovarian
region and in the abdominal incision. The pain
begins to abate after the first fifteen or twenty hours.
Opium should not be administered unless it is absolutely
necessary to allay nervous excitement in a cowardly woman.
In such a case a small dose (gr. ⅙) of morphine may
be administered hypodermically.</p>

<p>The writer rarely finds it necessary to administer an
anodyne. Most patients are able to endure the pain if
they are properly encouraged by the physician and the
nurse.</p>

<p>There are several objections to the administration of
opium. It increases the thirst and it diminishes the
functional activity of the gastro-intestinal tract. It retards
the passage of flatus by the rectum and causes tympanites,
and it increases the difficulty of moving the
bowels. It obscures and delays the recognition of symptoms
that may demand immediate treatment. The patient
who has had no opium is more comfortable at the
end of three or four days after celiotomy than one to
whom it has been given.</p>

<p>The patient should be encouraged to pass water voluntarily.
The application of hot moist cloths to the external
genitals sometimes facilitates urination. In many
cases the use of the catheter is never necessary. If the
urine is not voided about every eight hours, it should be
drawn with the catheter. Catheterization should be done
with strict attention to asepsis. The former frequency
of cystitis from the improper use of the catheter has
already been referred to. Catheterization should never
be performed under any circumstances by the aid of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
tactile sense alone. The nurse should always see what she
is doing. The catheter&mdash;metal, glass, or preferably soft
rubber&mdash;should be sterilized by boiling, and should be
preserved in a 1:20 solution of carbolic acid.</p>

<p>The catheter may be lubricated with sterilized oil or
glycerin. The labia should be separated, and the vestibule
and the external meatus should be wiped off with a
solution of bichloride of mercury (1:2000).</p>

<p>After the catheter has been used once it should be
thoroughly cleansed, inside and out, and sterilized by
boiling before being replaced in the carbolic solution.</p>

<p>The secretion of urine is always diminished for a few
days after celiotomy, probably on account of the restricted
ingestion of fluids. The writer has found the
average secretion in 111 cases of celiotomy on women to
be, during the first twenty-four hours, 13.4 ounces;
during the second twenty-four hours, 14.6 ounces; during
the third twenty-four hours, 19.6 ounces. In considering
these numbers it should be remembered that the gynecological
patient passes, before operation, a daily amount
of urine much less than that passed by the average healthy
woman.</p>

<p>Food is usually first administered at the end of forty-eight
hours. If the patient be feeble, nutriment may be
given by the mouth or the rectum before this time. The
patient may have any easily digested food that she wishes,
such as buttermilk, soup, beef-tea, milk or milk and
lime-water, soft-boiled egg, etc. The food should be
given frequently in small quantities. Buttermilk is one
of the best foods with which to begin. It gratifies thirst
and is more readily digested than milk. Half an ounce
to an ounce may be given every hour until the retentive
power of the stomach is determined.</p>

<p>The bowels should be moved at the end of forty-eight
or seventy-two hours. If the patient is uncomfortable
and is unable to pass flatus freely, or if there is any abdominal
distention, the purgative should be administered
at the earlier time (forty-eight hours). If she is comfortable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
and passes flatus easily, she may wait for three days.
Purgation is most readily produced with Rochelle salts,
given, in doses of ½ dram in about 3 or 4 ounces of
water or soda-water, every hour. After the patient has
taken five or six doses she usually feels the inclination to
have a movement. If she is unable to accomplish this,
she may be assisted with a rectal injection of 1 pint of
soap and water and 2 drams of turpentine. The bowels
should be moved at least once in every forty-eight hours
during the remainder of the convalescence.</p>

<p>Sometimes the bowels are more difficult to move, and
it is necessary to repeat the rectal injection at intervals
of two or three hours until a good movement is produced.
A compound enema composed of Epsom salts ℥j, glycerin
℥j, turpentine ℥iss, water ℥viij, injected high in the bowel
through a rectal tube, may be effective. If the Rochelle
salts are not retained, or if they fail to act, 1 grain of
calomel may be administered every hour for five or six
hours.</p>

<p>If the patient does well, vomiting does not often occur
after the first twenty-four hours, when the effects of the
ether have passed off. When vomiting occurs later than
this, it is usually accompanied by abdominal distention
and general abdominal pain. It is then an alarming
symptom, and may indicate the onset of intestinal paralysis
and general peritonitis.</p>

<p>This group of symptoms (vomiting, general abdominal
pain, and distention) demands immediate treatment. A
hot mustard plaster or a turpentine stupe should be placed
over the epigastrium, and an enema of 1 pint of water
and ½ ounce of turpentine should be administered, and
should be repeated every three or four hours until a fecal
movement occurs and flatus is freely discharged. At the
same time Rochelle salts should be administered, or,
if there is persistent vomiting, 1-grain doses of calomel.
The escape of flatus may be assisted by inserting a rectal
tube. In case of moderate distention or of intestinal
pain from inability to pass flatus, the insertion in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
anus of the ordinary rectal nozzle of the syringe will
usually give relief. If this is not sufficient, the long
rectal tube or a large rubber catheter should be introduced.
It should be well greased and passed slowly into
the rectum for a distance of 10 or 12 inches.</p>

<p>The patient is sometimes able to pass flatus when upon
her side, though she may not be able to do so upon her
back. Inability to pass flatus is not necessarily a sign of
peritonitis or intestinal paralysis. It may be caused by
the unaccustomed position, or pain or nervousness may
prevent the woman relaxing the sphincter ani.</p>

<p>If the vomiting persists and becomes bilious, relief is
sometimes obtained by thoroughly washing out the
stomach through the stomach-tube.</p>

<p>The internal administration of medicines&mdash;except the
purgatives already mentioned&mdash;is of little use in vomiting
of this character.</p>

<p>The pulse after celiotomy usually remains below 100.
It often, however, reaches 115 or 120, and sometimes
higher, in patients who have a favorable convalescence.
A rapid pulse unaccompanied by unfavorable abdominal
symptoms often indicates some heart-trouble.</p>

<p>A pulse of over 120 accompanied by abdominal distention
and vomiting should always excite alarm.</p>

<p>Strychnine and digitalis, administered hypodermically,
are the most useful medicines for strengthening the heart
and diminishing the rapidity of the pulse. They should
be given in large doses&mdash;1/20 of a grain of strychnine every
three or four hours, and 10 minims of tincture of digitalis
at similar intervals.</p>

<p>Hypodermic injections of strychnine are most useful
for shock after celiotomy. This drug may be exhibited
until the physiological action&mdash;twitching or jerking of the
muscles&mdash;is observed. The writer has administered between
1 and 2 grains during the first twenty-four hours
after celiotomy, with recovery.</p>

<p>The temperature after celiotomy runs no regular course.
It usually remains below 102° F. A greater elevation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
temperature than this may occur during a favorable convalescence;
and; on the other hand, a fatal termination
may take place when the temperature remains lower.
The maximum temperature is usually observed about
the second or third day.</p>

<p>The temperature often rises on account of very trivial
causes. It may go up one or two degrees if the patient
should become constipated, and will drop as soon as a
free fecal movement has taken place.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_207" src="images/fig_207.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 207.</span>&mdash;Composite temperature-chart of a series of 150 successful cases
of celiotomy: average temperatures, pulses, and respirations for two weeks after
operation.</p></div>

<p>The comfort of the patient is much increased by
sponging the arms and legs with tepid water. The nurse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
should be instructed to sponge the patient in this way
whenever the temperature reaches 102° F.</p>

<p>The patient should maintain the recumbent posture for
three weeks after celiotomy. She may then sit up in
bed for two or three days, and if then sufficiently strong,
she may leave the bed.</p>

<p>Too great haste in getting up may result in ventral
hernia. The incision should be strapped with adhesive
plaster for five or six weeks after operation, and the woman
should wear some simple form of abdominal binder for
the following six months, or for a year if the incision be
large. She should be warned against resuming hard
work, involving lifting or other abdominal strain, for several
months after operation. She should be told of the
possibility of ventral hernia, and advised to return immediately
for treatment should this condition appear.</p>

<p>The usual causes of death after celiotomy are peritonitis
and hemorrhage. The frequency of hemorrhage as
a cause of death is often overlooked. The writer feels confident
that many deaths which, without post-mortem examination,
are attributed to peritonitis, are really caused
by hemorrhage. Without doubt, peritonitis and hemorrhage
often occur together; the blood that escapes into
the peritoneal cavity may be too great in amount for absorption,
and may become septic. The source of the
hemorrhage is usually a vessel of the pedicle that escapes
from the embrace of an imperfectly applied ligature.
This accident should not happen if the operator is careful
to see that hemostasis is perfect before the abdomen is
closed. Bloody oozing from a surface of adhesion is not
sufficient to cause death, and may be removed by drainage;
the fatal hemorrhage comes from an arterial vessel
that has slipped from its ligature. All ligatured vessels
should be finally inspected immediately before the abdomen
is closed. If a stump is not perfectly dry, a reinforcing
ligature should be applied. Care in this particular
will save much subsequent anxiety. If the operator
knows that his ligatures have been securely applied, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
can exclude the possibility of hemorrhage in case alarming
symptoms should arise.</p>

<p>If the symptoms of the patient after celiotomy indicate
hemorrhage, the abdomen must be reopened and the
bleeding vessels secured.</p>

<p>The causes of peritonitis after celiotomy have already
been discussed.</p>

<p>The common symptoms are rapid pulse, abdominal distention
and pain with inability to pass flatus or feces, and
vomiting, which may finally become stercoraceous. The
temperature is usually elevated, though it may remain
normal or subnormal. Auscultation of the abdomen reveals
total absence of all peristaltic sounds. If these
symptoms are not arrested by the use of purgatives, turpentine
enemata, and the rectal tube, it is probable that
the result will be fatal. Death usually occurs on the
third day.</p>

<p>The mortality after celiotomy depends upon the condition
to be treated, the skill of the operator, and the
environment of the operation. Some operations, like
ventro-suspension of the uterus, are attended by no mortality.
The average mortality after celiotomy for large
numbers of gynecological cases of all kinds, in the hands
of experienced operators with good operative surroundings,
is about 5 per cent.

<p>A thorough knowledge of the anatomical relations
of the various structures in the pelvis is essential for the
performance of the various operations upon the uterus
and its appendages.</p>

<p>A detailed description of such anatomical relations is
out of place here. It is especially important to study
the distribution of the arterial supply and the relations
of the ureters. <a href="#fig_208">Fig. 208</a> will refresh the memory upon
these points.</p>

tortuously between the layers of the upper part of the
broad ligament, from the pelvic wall to the upper angle
of the uterus. Before reaching the uterus it divides into
two branches. The upper branch supplies the fundus
uteri; the lower branch anastomoses at the side of the
uterus with the uterine artery.</p>

<p>During its course in the broad ligament the ovarian
artery gives off branches to the ampulla and the isthmus
of the Fallopian tube, to the ovary, and to the round
ligament.</p>

ligaments. The upper part of the bladder, the anterior wall of the vagina, and

ligament.</p></div>

<p>The uterine artery arises from the anterior division of
the internal iliac, and runs downward and inward toward
the cervix uteri. The vessel is tortuous, and is loosely
supported by the cellular tissue at the base of the broad
ligament. The lowest point which it reaches is on a level
with the external os uteri, and at this point it crosses the
ureter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span></p>

<p>At about this point it gives off the circular artery of
the cervix, which anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite
side. The uterine artery then passes upward, and
reaches the uterus near the level of the internal os. It
passes along the side of the uterus in a very tortuous
manner, and anastomoses with the ovarian artery.</p>

<p>The vaginal arteries usually arise from the anterior
division of the internal iliac artery. They sometimes
arise from the uterine or middle hemorrhoidal artery.</p>

<p>The ureter passes behind and beneath the uterine
artery. The uterine artery crosses the ureter at about the
level of the external os uteri. At this point the ureter is
⅗ of an inch distant from the cervix. The distance between
the ureter and the artery at the point of crossing
is about ⅖ of an inch. It is important to remember these
relations in applying a ligature to the uterine artery.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the anatomical relations
are altered by any displacement of the uterus from its
normal position. Such displacement occurs in disease and
when the uterus is dragged upward or downward during
operation.</p>

<p>In conditions, such as cancer, which are accompanied
by hypertrophy of the cervix, the distance between the
ureter and the cervix is much diminished.</p>

<p><b id="REMOVAL_OF_THE_UTERINE_APPENDAGE_SALPINGO_OOPHORECTOMY">Removal of the Uterine Appendages (Salpingo-oöphorectomy).</b>&mdash;This
operation is performed by ligaturing
the ovarian artery in its course through the infundibulo-pelvic
ligament and at the uterine cornu, and
then excising the Fallopian tube and the ovary.</p>

<p>The peritoneum is opened, and the index and middle
fingers of the left hand are introduced into the abdomen.
If necessary, the omentum is swept upward out of the
pelvis. The fundus uteri is sought, and the fingers, with
the palmar surface directed downward, are passed over
the posterior face of the uterus, and then outward over
the posterior aspect of the broad ligament. The ovary
and tube are palpated, and are lifted forward upon the
palmar aspect of the two fingers or between the fingers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
perhaps with the subsequent assistance of the thumb,
into the abdominal incision. The infundibulo-pelvic
ligament is exposed, and is rendered tense by the pressure
of the fingers behind it. It will be observed that
the upper edge of the ligament is thick, while there is a
thin, sometimes transparent, area below the free edge.
The vessels run in the upper edge of the ligament, and a
ligature passed through the thin area will secure them
(<a href="#fig_210">Fig. 210</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 210.</span>&mdash;Salpingo-oöphorectomy. On the right side ligatures have been
placed about the ovarian artery, at the uterine horn, and at the pelvic wall. On
the left side the tube and ovary have been excised between such ligatures. If
bleeding takes place from the broad ligament, the anterior and posterior peritoneal
aspects may be united by suture.</p></div>

<p>The heavy silk carried in the pedicle-needle should be
used. The ligature should be placed sufficiently near the
pelvic wall to permit complete excision of the tube and
ovary without cutting too close to the ligature. The
broad ligament should then be transfixed by a second
ligature at a point somewhat to the inside of the first.
The second ligature should embrace the ovarian ligament,
the isthmus of the tube, and the uterine end of
the ovarian artery. This ligature should be placed close
to the uterine cornu, in order to permit complete excision
of the ovary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span></p>

<p>The Fallopian tube, the ovary, and the mesosalpinx
are then cut away with the scissors. There is usually no
bleeding whatever from the unligatured portion of the
broad ligament between the two ligatures. The stumps
should be carefully inspected, and any bleeding point in
the intervening portion of the broad ligament should be
picked up and secured by fine ligature; or the peritoneal
edges may be united by suture.</p>

<p>This method of operating is in accord with the best
surgical principles.</p>

<p>The vessels are secured in their course by ligatures
which embrace a minimum amount of surrounding tissue.
In the early days of modern abdominal surgery, the operation
usually advised was performed with the Tait knot
(<a href="#fig_211">Fig. 211</a>) or the link-ligature (<a href="#fig_212">Fig. 212</a>).</p>

<table class="dual">

<p>The ovary and the tube are drawn into the abdominal
incision, and the pedicle formed by the broad ligament is
transfixed with the pedicle-needle carrying a double ligature.</p>

<p>The loop of the ligature is passed over the tube and
ovary and the Tait knot is tied, or the ligature is cut and
each half of the pedicle is separately secured, the ligature
being crossed or linked in the middle of the stump, to
prevent separation.</p>

<p>The operators who apply the ligature in this way do so
because they fear hemorrhage if every portion of the
broad ligament is not secured.</p>

<p>This fear is unfounded. The objections to this form
of ligature, the Tait or the link-ligature, may be given by
the following quotation from a former paper by the writer.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span></p>

<p>“The objections to these ligatures are: The liability to
slip; the difficulty or impossibility in some cases of removing
all the ovary and tube; the fact that the broad
ligament is puckered up and made more tense than normal,
and may for this reason cause subsequent pain and
discomfort; an unnecessary amount of tissue is strangulated.</p>

<p>“Most operators have seen cases, either in their own
experience or in the experience of others, in which the
ligature has slipped from the pedicle, either during the
operation or some days afterward. I think that this
accident, usually unrecognized, is a very common cause
of death after oöphorectomy. Tait speaks of a certain
number of cases in his own experience in which a hematoma
occurred in the broad ligament some hours or days
after operation. He says, ‘I cannot form any exact estimate
of how many cases of these operative hematoceles
I have seen, but it certainly is not less than 50, and is
more likely to be 70 or 80.’</p>

<p>“It seems probable that this accident is due to the retraction
or slipping of the artery from the embrace of the
ligature, while the remaining mass of tissue which
forms the pedicle is still retained, and the hemorrhage,
therefore, is confined to the broad ligament. I have seen
this accident happen before the abdomen had been closed,
and have sought for and ligated separately the retracted
vessel.</p>

<p>“Slipping of the ligature is due to the form of the
mass of tissue which is ligated. The broad ligament is
drawn up into a more or less conical shape, all parts converging
toward the ligature, and the ligature is really
placed at the apex of a cone from which it may readily
slip; and the elastic artery, tied when upon the stretch,
tends to retract and escape from the embrace of the ligature.</p>

<p>“The second objection is the difficulty or impossibility
of removing all the ovary and tube. If the broad ligament
is tense, as it often is in single women, or if it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
thickened from inflammatory deposit, it is sometimes impossible
to bring the tube and ovary through the abdominal
incision and to obtain a pedicle which may be ligated
so that we may with safety remove all of the ovary.
And it is in just such cases that it is usually most desirable
that all ovarian tissue should be removed.</p>

<p>“The third objection&mdash;the puckering and tension of
the broad ligament&mdash;may be of less importance than
those just considered. However, it seems probable that
some of the pain which women suffer after oöphorectomy
is due to the traction and counter-traction exerted by
different parts of the broad ligament upon a sensitive
cicatrix. The broad ligament is pulled up from different
directions and converges to the cicatrix, which becomes
the point from which the lines of traction radiate.</p>

<p>“It was thought that in case of retroversion this tension
of the broad ligament would maintain the uterus in
place, the ligaments acting as guys. This, however, is
not true. Repeated secondary operations have shown
that the uterus has fallen back again to extreme retroversion,
notwithstanding such methods of ligature of the
broad ligaments.</p>

<p>“The fourth objection is one which appeals to our
surgical sense. It is always better surgery to ligate
the vessel alone than to include with it a mass of surrounding
tissue.”</p>

<p>If the isthmus of the Fallopian tube is diseased, as in
some cases of pyosalpinx, so that it is necessary to exsect
the tube from the uterine cornu, the second ligature may
be passed immediately beneath the tube, including the
ovarian ligament and the ovarian artery, but not including
the tube; the tube may then be cut out by a wedge-shaped
incision in the horn of the uterus. The uterine
wound should be closed by interrupted suture (<a href="#fig_212">Fig. 212</a>, <i>A</i>).
In such cases, however, if the tubal disease is bilateral,
it is best to remove the uterus as well as the appendages.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to place both ligatures before cutting
away the ovary and tube. The first ligature may
be placed about the proximal portion of the ovarian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
artery, and then the infundibulo-pelvic ligament may be
cut, bleeding from the distal end being controlled with
forceps. This will enable the operator readily to bring
the ovary and tube through the incision and to ligate the
ovarian artery at the uterine cornu.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>If adhesions exist, they should be broken with the
fingers, or the patient should be placed in the Trendelenburg
position and the adhesions should be divided with
scissors. The tube and ovary are sometimes completely
imbedded in adhesions, and it is necessary to shell them
out by careful work with the fingers. The adhesions
may be so dense and the anatomical relations so altered
that it is difficult or impossible to determine what is ovary
and what is tube until the mass is brought into the abdominal
incision. In these cases the experienced operator may
work by the sense of touch alone. The inexperienced
operator had better expose the parts and obtain the assistance
of visual examination.</p>

<p>The fundus uteri can usually be determined, and will
form a valuable landmark. The enucleation is most
easily performed with the fingers. The index and middle
fingers, with the palmar surfaces turned downward,
should be passed outward from the posterior aspect of the
uterus, and should seek a plane along which the structures
most readily separate. As a rule, adhesions give
way more easily than the tissues of normal structures.
Adhesions should not be roughly torn: they should be
pushed away from the posterior aspect of the ovary and
broad ligament.</p>

<p>The adhesions between the ovary and the broad ligament
must be broken by pressure with the fingers before
the ovary can readily be brought into the abdominal incision.</p>

<p>After all other adhesions have been relieved it is often
found that the ovary still lies low in the pelvis, glued to
the posterior aspect of the broad ligament. It should
not be dragged, in this condition, into the incision, or
the broad ligament may be badly lacerated. It should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
be peeled off from the broad ligament and rolled up to
the incision.</p>

<p>After the structures have been carefully examined and
the anatomical relations determined the ligatures should
be placed and the tube and ovary cut away. The bleeding
from the pelvic adhesions is usually arrested or much
diminished as soon as the ovarian artery is ligated. It is
best, therefore, to waste no time in attempts to arrest
moderate hemorrhage until the appendages have been removed.
The pelvis should then be inspected and any
bleeding points secured. Omental adhesions should be
ligated, if necessary, as they are divided.</p>

<p>If there is a general oozing from the bed of adhesions
that cannot be controlled by ligature, one or two gauze
pads should be pressed over the region and retained there
until the abdominal sutures have been placed. If the
bleeding continues notwithstanding such sponge-pressure,
it may be necessary to employ drainage. The bleeding
may always be controlled by the pressure of the end of
the gauze drain placed directly over the raw surface.</p>

<p>If the operator is anxious to arrest menstruation, he must
be certain to remove all ovarian tissue and the Fallopian
tubes at the uterine cornua. Sometimes, after an adherent
ovary has been enucleated, part of the ovarian
stroma remains glued to the pelvic wall, the posterior
face of the broad ligament, or some other structure.
These portions of ovary should be carefully picked
off with the forceps. If the operator doubts the complete
removal of all ovarian tissue, he should make a
note to this effect in the history of the case. Were this
always done, the existence of a supernumerary ovary
would not be so often assumed.</p>

<p>The directions that have been given here apply to the
removal of tubal tumors and small cystic and solid tumors
of the ovary. When the ovary is removed there is but
little, if any, advantage in leaving the corresponding
Fallopian tube in case the tube on the opposite side is
healthy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span></p>

<p>If the patient is anxious for children, the operator
should remember that conception is possible with one
tube and one ovary, though they be on opposite sides.
If an ovarian tumor is removed independently of the
corresponding Fallopian tube, the pedicle of the ovary
should be transfixed and ligatured in two or more masses.</p>

<p><b id="REMOVAL_OF_AN_OVARIAN_CYST">Removal of an Ovarian Cyst.</b>&mdash;The removal of a
large ovarian cyst may be facilitated by preliminary tapping
as soon as the peritoneum is opened, and withdrawal
of the fluid contents. As a general rule, this procedure
is advisable if the cyst is too large to be removed through
a 3- or 4-inch incision. If, however, the operator should
suspect the contents of the cyst to be septic, it is safest
to enlarge the incision and to remove the tumor intact,
thus avoiding infection of the peritoneum. This advice
is especially applicable to dermoid cysts. The contents
of such cysts are very often septic. They are thick, and
contain a large amount of solid material which passes
with difficulty through the trocar. The walls of the cyst
are friable and easily torn, so that the puncture-wound
of the trocar becomes enlarged and the cyst-contents
escape around it; and, finally, the contents of a dermoid
are very difficult to remove from the peritoneum.</p>

<p>The dermoid character of a cyst may be suspected from
the dull appearance of the walls and the putty-like feeling
upon palpation. They are usually of small size, and
may be removed bodily through an incision of moderate
extent.</p>

<p>Every tumor should be carefully examined before the
trocar is plunged into it. The operator should make
certain by palpation that the tumor is cystic. The trocar
has been thrust into the pregnant uterus, and frequently
into a fibroid tumor. In the case of a fibroid profuse
hemorrhage may occur from such an accident. The
hemorrhage may usually be controlled by forcing a small
sponge or gauze pack into the puncture wound. Before
tapping the cyst the operator should pass his hand around
it and determine the position and character of adhesions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span></p>

<p>Small cysts about the size of a child’s head may be
tapped with the small trocar. The larger instrument is
used in cysts of greater size.</p>

<p>In a multilocular cyst the largest loculus should be
tapped first. Sponges should be placed in the abdomen
around the point selected for puncture. An incision
about half an inch in length should be made through the
outer coat of the cyst, and the trocar should then be introduced.
As the fluid escapes through the trocar and
the rubber tube into a vessel at the side of the table, and
as the cyst becomes flaccid, the wall of the cyst near the
trocar should be seized with large forceps. As the tumor
diminishes in size it should be dragged through the abdominal
incision. This procedure should not be done
quickly or roughly, or adherent intestines may be torn,
and bleeding from omental adhesions may escape detection.</p>

<p>As the cyst is drawn out the surface should be examined
and adhesions should be separated, and ligatured, if
necessary, as they appear. Omental adhesions usually
require ligature. The bleeding from omental vessels is
often profuse and is not arrested spontaneously. An adherent
omentum should be ligatured with medium-sized
silk in small sections, not in one mass, before it is cut
away from the tumor.</p>

<p>The intestine is sometimes so adherent to the surface
of the tumor that it cannot be separated without serious
danger to the intestinal wall. In such a case it is best
to cut out the adherent portion of the outer wall of the
tumor and leave it glued to the intestine. If there is
bleeding from the raw surface, it may be checked by
folding in the bleeding area with silk suture.</p>

<p>While the operator is dealing with the adhesions the
assistant should see that the opening in the cyst is kept
in a dependent position and that cyst-contents do not
escape into the abdomen. This precaution should always
be taken, though it is especially important in the cases
of septic and papillomatous cysts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span></p>

<p>When the pedicle of the cyst is exposed, it should be
ligatured as already advised. If the stump of the pedicle
is very broad, it may be folded in or covered with peritoneum
to prevent intestinal adhesions to it.</p>

<p>The other ovary should always be examined before
closing the abdomen.</p>

<p><b id="OPERATION_FOR_THE_REMOVAL_OF_INTRA_LIGAMENTOUS_CYSTS">Operation for the Removal of Intra-ligamentous
Cysts.</b>&mdash;Intra-ligamentous cysts grow between the folds
of the broad ligament. Any oöphoritic tumor may be
intra-ligamentous, though the condition is most usually
found in cysts of the paroöphoron and the parovarium.</p>

<p>The intra-ligamentous cyst may drag out the broad
ligament so that a pedicle may be formed, and the tumor
may be removed by the methods already described.</p>

<p>In other cases, however, the cyst is strictly sessile. It
lies between the layers of the broad ligament, deep in the
pelvis, or perhaps it may have migrated to some other
part of the abdomen behind the peritoneum.</p>

<p>The removal of such tumors requires accurate anatomical
knowledge of the region in which the growth is
situated.</p>

<p>It is necessary to incise the peritoneal covering of the
tumor and to enucleate it from its bed. The peritoneum
should be incised in the position in which there are fewest
blood-vessels. Thus, if the tumor has migrated between
the layers of the mesocolon, the incision should be
made through the outer peritoneal layer.</p>

<p>Intra-ligamentous cysts often have no pedicular attachments
whatever, and may be enucleated without the application
of ligature. In other cases a distinct vascular
pedicle is found after the peritoneal investment has been
opened and its adhesions to the cyst-wall have been separated.</p>

<p>The relations of an intra-ligamentous cyst should be
carefully examined before the surgeon proceeds with the
operation, and such a cyst should not be mistaken for an
extra-ligamentous cyst that has become adherent.</p>

<p>If the tumor is situated between the layers of the broad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
ligament, it is advisable, as a preliminary step, to ligate
the ovarian artery in the infundibulo-pelvic ligament and
at the cornu of the uterus. This may usually be readily
done; much subsequent bleeding will be prevented by it.</p>

<p>The peritoneum is then incised at the most convenient
point over the surface of the tumor, and the surgeon,
with the fingers, knife-handle, or closed blunt scissors,
proceeds with the enucleation. If inflammatory adhesions
have not taken place, enucleation is usually easy.
Bleeding vessels should be secured by forceps as they appear,
and should be ligated, if necessary, after the cyst is
removed.</p>

<p>If a pedicle or fleshy adhesion is met, it should be
ligated before division.</p>

<p>During the enucleation the surgeon should follow closely
the surface of the tumor. When he has reached a point
deep in the pelvis he should be especially careful to avoid
injury of the large vessels and the ureter. If the cyst is
difficult of removal in this region, it may be advisable to
cut out a portion of the cyst-wall and leave it.</p>

<p>Preliminary tapping of intra-ligamentous cysts is not
often necessary. They are usually of moderate size, and
enucleation may be most readily performed if the cyst is
tense.</p>

<p>Sometimes large cysts are but partly intra-ligamentous:
the greater portion is free, while the base is included between
the layers of the broad ligament. In such cases it
is best to tap the cyst and then to enucleate the base as
already described.</p>

<p>In other cases the process of enucleation may be facilitated
and rendered safe by incising the cyst-wall and introducing
two fingers into the cavity to act as guides in
separating the cyst from structures deep in the pelvis.</p>

<p>After the cyst has been removed and bleeding points
have been secured by ligature, the raw surface, or the bed
of the tumor, may be obliterated by bringing the sides
into apposition by layers of buried fine silk sutures and
by closing with suture the incision in the peritoneum.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
These raw surfaces often contract very much by the falling
together of the sides after the tumor has been removed.</p>

<p>If bleeding from the bed of the tumor cannot be thoroughly
arrested, it is unsafe to close the incision in the
peritoneum, for a hematoma will form and will cause subsequent
trouble. In such a case the gauze drain should
be introduced into the bed of the tumor, perhaps after
partial closure of the peritoneal incision. Or if the bleeding
be very profuse, the edges of the incision in the
broad ligament should be sutured to the lower angle of
the abdominal wound, and the cavity should be packed
with gauze.</p>

<p>The sutures that attach the broad ligament to the abdominal
incision may be passed through the whole thickness
of the abdominal wall, or through only the fascia,
muscle, and peritoneum. The ends of the sutures should
be left long to facilitate removal.</p>

<p>In the removal of a cyst of the parovarium by enucleation,
the tube and ovary should not be sacrificed unless
they are diseased. Small cysts of the parovarium which
develop between the layers of the mesosalpinx may very
easily be removed by simple incision of the peritoneal
capsule and enucleation of the cyst, without injury to
the tube and ovary.</p>

<p><b id="MARSUPIALIZATION_OF_THE_CYST">Marsupialization of the Cyst.</b>&mdash;In rare cases a cyst
is found to be so firmly and generally adherent to surrounding
structures that its removal is impossible. It is
then necessary to practise marsupialization.</p>

<p>The cyst should be evacuated with the trocar, which is
introduced at a point which can be readily brought to the
abdominal incision. Vegetations, etc. should be removed
from the interior of the cyst with the fingers. The
opening in the cyst should then be attached to the lower
angle of the abdominal incision by interrupted sutures
of strong silk that pass through the whole thickness of
the abdominal wall and of the cyst-wall. The sutures
should be placed close together, and the ends should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
left long to facilitate removal. The upper portion of the
abdominal incision should be closed with interrupted
sutures.</p>

<p>A large double drainage-tube of rubber should be introduced
into the cyst, and strips of gauze should be packed
around the tube.</p>

<p>The subsequent treatment consists of frequent washing
of the interior of the cyst. The sutures in the cyst-wall
should be removed at the end of two weeks.</p>

<p>Though marsupialization frequently results in cure, yet
it should never be practised unless it is absolutely necessary.
It exposes the patient to the dangers of prolonged
suppuration and persistent fistula. Malignant degeneration
has occurred in the wound. Papilloma may extend to
the peritoneum. The procedure is of but little use in the
case of multilocular tumors, as all the loculi cannot be
evacuated.</p>

<h4 id="OPERATION_FOR_REMOVAL_OF_THE_UTERUS">OPERATION FOR REMOVAL OF THE UTERUS.</h4>

<p>The uterus may be removed through an abdominal incision
(abdominal hysterectomy), or it may be removed
through the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy). A combination
of the two methods of operating is sometimes employed.</p>

<p>In many conditions it is not necessary to remove the
cervix. Partial hysterectomy or supra-vaginal amputation
of the uterus at some convenient point of the cervix
may be performed.</p>

<p>Such supra-vaginal amputation of the uterus may be
done in nearly all operations that are not performed for
malignant disease. In sarcoma or cancer the whole
uterus should be removed at the vaginal junction, and,
if necessary, the upper portion of the vagina should be
excised.</p>

<p>In the case of fibroid tumor and in non-malignant disease
of the body of the uterus supra-vaginal amputation
is sufficient. Supra-vaginal amputation is an easier and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
safer operation than complete hysterectomy. Abdominal
hysterectomy is most easily performed with the patient
in the Trendelenburg position.</p>

<p><b id="SUPRA_VAGINAL_AMPUTATION_OF_THE_UTERUS">Supra-vaginal Amputation of the Uterus.</b>&mdash;After
the abdomen has been opened, the ovarian artery should
be ligated in the infundibulo-pelvic ligament, as in the
operation of salpingo-oöphorectomy. A second ligature,
or forceps, should then be placed upon the ovarian artery
at the uterine cornu.</p>

<p>The round ligament should then be ligatured with
medium-sized silk at a point situated about an inch from
the uterus. Similar ligatures should then be placed about
the ovarian artery and the round ligament on the opposite
side.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_213" src="images/fig_213.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 213.</span>&mdash;Supra-vaginal amputation of the uterus, first step: ligatures have

<p>The infundibulo-pelvic ligament immediately outside
of the abdominal ostium of the tube, the round ligament
between the ligature and the cornu, and the broad
ligament as far as the uterus should then be divided with
scissors on each side.</p>

<p>The uterus is thus freed from all its attachments down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
to a point somewhat above the level of the internal os.
The vessels that remain to be secured are the uterine
arteries.</p>

<p>The peritoneum is next divided by a transverse incision
across the anterior face of the uterus, immediately below
the line of reflection of the peritoneum from the uterus
to the bladder. This incision should join at each end
the incisions that had been previously made in dividing
the broad ligaments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 214.</span>&mdash;Supra-vaginal amputation of the uterus, second step: the broad ligaments

<p>The bladder should then be dissected from the anterior
face of the uterus and cervix, down to the vaginal junction.</p>

<p>The bladder is but loosely attached to the uterus, and
may be readily pushed off with the finger or with
closed scissors. The finger pressed out to a short distance
on each side of the cervix will push away the anterior
layer of the broad ligament with the bladder, so that the
uterus is perfectly free in front.

has been incised across the anterior face of the uterus; the bladder has been
dissected from the cervix; the bases of the broad ligaments have been opened;
the uterine arteries have been secured by ligatures placed between the ureters
and the cervix.</p></div>

<p>The posterior layer of the broad ligament and the
cellular tissue may then be divided, with scissors, along
the side of the uterus down to a point somewhat below
the level of the internal os. This incision should not be
made too close to the uterus, or the uterine artery that
runs up along side of the uterus and cervix may be
divided. The operator should place one or two fingers
upon the posterior aspect of the broad ligament, immediately
beside the cervix, and while the uterus is drawn
upward should pass a heavy ligature beneath the tissue
that includes the uterine artery. The pulsation of the
uterine artery may usually be felt by the finger placed behind
the broad ligament. This ligature includes the cellular
tissue at the base of the broad ligament, the uterine
artery, and part of the posterior peritoneal layer of the
broad ligament. It does not pass through the anterior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
peritoneal layer of the broad ligament, which had been
previously dissected away. The ligature should be placed
as closely as possible to the cervix without including
cervical tissue. It should be remembered that the ureter
lies about half an inch from the side of the normal cervix
and at the level of the external os. The ureter is usually
more remote than this when the ligature is passed, because
the uterus is drawn upward and the ureter is pushed
aside by the fingers at the side of the cervix.</p>

<p>The uterine artery should be secured in a similar way
upon the opposite side.</p>

<p>The bases of the broad ligaments should then be
divided with scissors between the cervix and the ligatures
of the uterine arteries. To prevent slipping of the ligature,
ample tissue should be left between the incision and
the ligature. As the cervix is not malignant, the incision
may be made as close to this structure as necessary.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span></p>

<p>When the cervical canal is opened, it may be immediately
sterilized with a solution of bichloride of mercury
(1:500).</p>

<p>As the uterus is cut away the flaps of the cervix are
secured with forceps. The cervical stump is usually
white and dry.</p>

<p>The flaps of the cervix should next be united by interrupted
silk suture. Care should be taken to avoid passing
a suture through the cervical canal, as it might become
infected.</p>

<p>The anterior peritoneal layer of the broad ligament
and the peritoneal reflection from the bladder are then
drawn over the field of operation and secured by fine silk
sutures to the posterior peritoneal layer and the posterior
aspect of the cervix. The stump of the cervix, the
stump of the uterine arteries, and the cellular tissue of
the broad ligaments are thus covered by peritoneum. The
only raw surfaces exposed are the stumps of the ovarian
arteries and of the round ligaments. These surfaces may
also be covered if the operator so desires.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span></p>

<p><b id="PRESERVATION_OF_THE_OVARIES_IN_HYSTERECTOMY">Preservation of the Ovaries in Hysterectomy.</b>&mdash;Many
surgeons consider it advisable to leave the ovaries
in hysterectomy for fibroid tumor of the uterus in case
these organs are not diseased. If the woman has not yet
reached the menopause the disagreeable symptoms of the
artificially induced menopause are thus avoided, and any
metabolic function that the ovaries may possess is preserved.
In hysterectomy for fibroid in women under forty
years of age with healthy ovaries it is advisable to leave
these organs if this can be done without seriously complicating
the operation.</p>

<p>The ovarian artery should be ligated between the ovary
and the uterus and the broad ligament should be divided
inside of this ligature. The tubes may be left if they can
not readily be removed.</p>

<p><b id="COMPLETE_ABDOMINAL_HYSTERECTOMY">Complete Abdominal Hysterectomy.</b>&mdash;In this operation
the uterus is removed at the vaginal junction. The
operation is absolutely necessary in cases of malignant
disease of the body and neck of the uterus. It is not
often necessary in the treatment of the other conditions
for which hysterectomy is performed. The operation requires
a longer time than the operation of partial hysterectomy;
it is often accompanied by profuse bleeding
from the edge of the divided vagina; there is more danger
of injury to the ureters, and there is more danger of septic
infection, because the vagina is opened; and, finally,
the operation very considerably shortens the vaginal
canal.</p>

<p>The first steps in the operation of complete hysterectomy
are the same as those in partial hysterectomy. In
the case of malignant disease of the cervix the ligatures
on the uterine arteries should be placed as far from the
cervix as possible without including the ureters.</p>

<p>Some surgeons advise the preliminary introduction of
bougies into the ureters in order to locate these structures
and thus prevent injury to them. If the operator is sure
of the position of the ureter he may ligate the uterine
artery upon the outer side of the ureter, and carry the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
incision through structures well outside of the diseased
cervix.</p>

<p>After the vessels have been secured and the bladder
has been separated from the uterus and the upper part of
the vagina, and the broad ligaments have been divided
down to the vagina, a transverse incision is made with
the knife or scissors into the anterior vaginal fornix.
The position of the anterior vaginal fornix may be determined
by palpation and percussion. A drum-like sound
is obtained by snapping the finger upon the tense vaginal
wall.</p>

<p>With the finger in the opening in the anterior vaginal
fornix as a guide, the incision is continued around the
sides and posterior wall of the vagina. The edge of the
vagina is secured by forceps, and bleeding vessels in the
walls are ligated. When hemostasis is complete the
vagina is closed by sutures that pass through the outer
portions of the walls, but do not enter the vaginal canal.
The peritoneum is then drawn over the field of operation
and the abdomen is closed. If hemostasis is not
perfect, gauze drainage through the vagina or the abdominal
incision must be employed.</p>

<p>Some operators do not ligate the uterine arteries until
the vagina has been opened. The ovarian arteries are
secured, the bladder is separated from the uterus and the
upper part of the vagina, and the broad ligaments are
divided down to a point somewhat below the level of the
internal os.</p>

<p>The anterior vaginal fornix is then opened, and the
incision is carried around toward the lateral fornices as
far as may be done without injury to the uterine arteries.
The uterus is then drawn forward and the posterior vaginal
fornix is opened, the finger introduced through the
opening into the anterior fornix acting as a guide.</p>

<p>The uterus is now attached to the body only by two
lateral bands of tissue that include the cellular tissue at
the base of the broad ligament, the uterine artery, and a
strip of vaginal mucous membrane over the lateral vaginal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
fornix. This band of tissue, exclusive of the vaginal
mucous membrane, is then secured by a ligature that
does not enter the vagina, but passes immediately above
the strip of vaginal mucous membrane. A finger introduced
into the vagina serves to guide the ligature-needle.
The uterus may then be cut away.</p>

<p>The ligatures of the uterine arteries are sometimes left
long, the ends being carried down into the vagina and a
gauze drain being introduced into the vagina, the upper
portion of the drain reaching just above the level of the
stump of the uterine arteries.</p>

<p>The peritoneum may be left open, or it may be drawn
over the drain and the field of operation as already described.</p>

<p>Drainage through the vagina in this way is advisable
if the hemostasis be not perfect and if the operator fears
septic infection.</p>

<p>In hysterectomy for cancer of the cervix it is usually
advisable to remove as much as possible of the cancerous
mass by a preliminary operation two or three days beforehand.
The diseased tissues should be cut away with the
knife, scissors, and the sharp curette, the cavity seared
with the thermo-cautery, and closed by approximation of
the edges with a few silk sutures. The dangers of septic
infection and of transplantation of cancer-cells during the
hysterectomy are thus diminished.</p>

<p>The surgeon should always keep in mind the possibility
of the transplantation of cancer-cells from diseased into
healthy tissues. It seems very probable that some cases
of recurrence have been due to this cause. During hysterectomy
the operator should therefore avoid, as much
as possible, cutting into or manipulating the cancer mass.
Instruments, such as hemostatic forceps and volsella forceps,
which have grasped diseased tissue, should not be
used upon healthy tissue without previous sterilization;
and sponges and pads which have been in contact with
the cancerous tissue should be discarded.</p>

<p>The methods of operating just described, modified to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
meet special indications, are applicable to all cases in
which hysterectomy is required.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in cases of fibroid tumor, the broad ligament
is very much hypertrophied and contains enormous
veins, and additional ligatures besides those on the ovarian
and uterine arteries are required. It is often necessary
to place a large number of forceps upon bleeding
vessels on the surface of the tumor as it is cut away from
the broad ligament.</p>

<p>The anatomical relations are often very much disturbed,
and it may be impossible to determine the position
of the cervix and the uterine arteries until the
greater part of the tumor has been freed from its connections.
Sometimes the tumor so fills the pelvis that it is
impossible to ligate, at first, both ovarian arteries. The
operator must first attack the more accessible side, ligate
the ovarian artery, cut away the broad ligament, strip
off the bladder, ligate the uterine artery, and perhaps
divide the cervix, before he proceeds to the other side.
Bleeding from the tumor must be controlled by the careful
application of forceps or ligatures. An inaccessible
uterine artery is sometimes most readily reached in this
way from below, after the attachments upon the opposite
side have been divided and the cervix has been amputated.
Some operators perform hysterectomy in all cases
by ligating and cutting away from above downward
on one side&mdash;the more accessible&mdash;then cutting across
the cervix, and ligating and cutting away on the opposite
side from below upward.</p>

<p>The difficulties are greatest in the case of intra-ligamentous
fibroids. Such operations are among the most
difficult in surgery. The directions given for the treatment
of intra-ligamentous cysts are applicable also to this
condition. The surgeon should always at first secure the
ovarian arteries if possible. He should then incise the
peritoneal investment across the anterior or posterior face
of the tumor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span></p>

<p>Enormous veins often lie immediately beneath the peritoneum,
and care must be taken to avoid injuring them.</p>

<p>The peritoneum should be stripped off with the fingers
or with blunt scissors. Bleeding vessels are secured with
forceps as they appear. No attaching structures should
be divided until they have been carefully examined, for
all anatomical relations are distorted by these growths.
The ureter may pass over the top of the tumor, far removed
from its normal position on the pelvic floor.</p>

<p>After the surgeon has started the enucleation of a
tumor of this kind he must complete the operation.
Bleeding cannot be arrested until the tumor has been
enucleated, the cervix exposed, and the uterine arteries
secured.</p>

<p>The operation is often accompanied by very profuse
hemorrhage, but this hemorrhage is always arrested by
the ligature of the ovarian and uterine arteries, which
alone supply the growth. The surgeon should therefore
not delay the operation by the ligature of separate bleeding
points until the main vessels have been secured.</p>

<p><b id="VAGINAL_HYSTERECTOMY">Vaginal Hysterectomy.</b>&mdash;Vaginal hysterectomy may
be performed for the relief of any condition in which
the uterus or attached tumor is sufficiently small to pass
through the vagina. The operation is very popular with
some surgeons. It is but rarely used by the writer. The
difficulty in dealing with adhesions and other complications
in the upper part of the pelvis seems to be much
less when the operation is performed through an abdominal
incision.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_218" src="images/fig_218.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 218.</span>&mdash;Lateral vaginal retractor.]
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span></p></div>

<p>The technique of vaginal hysterectomy varies considerably
in the hands of different operators. The vaginal
vault is opened with the knife, the scissors, or the
cautery. The vessels of the broad ligament are secured
with the ligature or with the clamp. The uterus is
sometimes divided by longitudinal incision and the halves
are separately removed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_219" src="images/fig_219.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 219.</span>&mdash;Vaginal hysterectomy with clamps: first step (Baldy).</p></div>

<p>The following are the general directions for the performance
of the operation:</p>

<p>The woman is placed in the lithotomy position. The
vagina is opened with the Sims speculum and with lateral
vaginal retractors (<a href="#fig_218">Fig. 218</a>).</p>

<p>If the cervix is septic, it is thoroughly curetted, sterilized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
with the cautery or by other means, and the sides of
the excavation are united by suture.</p>

<p>The cervix is seized by tenaculum forceps and dragged
downward and forward.</p>

<p>A transverse incision with knife, scissors, or cautery is
made in the posterior vaginal fornix, and Douglas’s pouch
is opened.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_220" src="images/fig_220.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 220.</span>&mdash;Vaginal hysterectomy with clamps: second step (Baldy).</p></div>

<p>A sponge is introduced into the peritoneum behind
the uterus.</p>

<p>Some operators suture the posterior peritoneal layer
of Douglas’s pouch to the posterior vaginal wall, to
control bleeding and to prevent stripping of the peritoneum.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span></p>

<p>The cervix is now dragged backward and a transverse
incision is made across the anterior vaginal fornix.</p>

<p>The bladder is carefully dissected from the anterior
face of the cervix with the knife, scissors, and finger,
and the utero-vesical fold of peritoneum is opened. The
peritoneum and the anterior vaginal wall may here also
be united by suture.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_221" src="images/fig_221.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 221.</span>&mdash;Vaginal hysterectomy with clamps: third and final step (Baldy).</p></div>

<p>An incision may then be made through the vaginal
mucous membrane of the lateral fornices, uniting the
anterior and posterior incisions.</p>

<p>With a finger in Douglas’s pouch as a guide, the
broad ligaments are then secured in successive portions
by ligature or by strong clamp forceps, and the uterus is
cut away with the scissors as the ligatures or clamps are
placed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span></p>

<p>As the upper portion of the broad ligaments is reached
the procedure may be facilitated by retroverting or anteverting
the uterus, the fundus being dragged through the
posterior or the anterior incisions in the vaginal vault.</p>

<p>The tubes and ovaries should be removed when possible,
especially in the case of malignant disease.</p>

<p>After the uterus has been removed the vagina may be
packed with a gauze drain that reaches upward between
the stumps of the uterine arteries; or, if ligatures have
been used, the vaginal vault may be closed. The former
procedure is the safer. When the gauze drain is
used, it is advisable to leave the ends of the ligatures on
the uterine arteries long and protruding into the vagina.
The ligatures usually become infected, and their removal
is facilitated by this procedure. If clamps are used, they
should be removed in forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>The treatment after vaginal hysterectomy is the same
as that already described after celiotomy.</p>

<p><b id="COMBINED_VAGINAL_AND_ABDOMINAL_HYSTERECTOMY">Combined Vaginal and Abdominal Hysterectomy.</b>&mdash;A
combined vaginal and abdominal operation is
sometimes performed in order to enable the surgeon to
deal with adhesions and other complications in the upper
part of the pelvis.</p>

<p>The operation is usually begun below. The vaginal
connections and the bladder are separated from the uterus,
and the bases of the broad ligaments are secured
with the ligature or the clamp; the cervix is freed from
its attachments to the broad ligament.</p>

<p>The abdomen is then opened and the operation is finished
from above, the uterus being removed through the
abdominal incision.</p>

<p>The writer performs the combined operation in the reverse
order, as follows:</p>

<p>The abdomen is first opened. The ovarian arteries
and the round ligaments are secured by ligature. The
bladder is separated from the uterus and the upper part
of the vagina. The broad ligaments are divided to a
point somewhat below the level of the internal os.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span></p>

<p>A gauze pad is then introduced to the bottom of Douglas’s
pouch, and another to the bottom of the space between
the uterus and the bladder. The abdominal incision
is then closed.</p>

<p>The rest of the operation is performed through the
vagina. The posterior and anterior vaginal fornices are
opened by incisions made directly upon the gauze pads.
The vaginal mucous membrane is divided over the vaginal
fornices by an incision that joins the anterior and
posterior incisions in the vaginal vault. The bases of the
broad ligaments are secured by strong clamp-forceps, and
the uterus is cut away and removed through the vagina.
The gauze pads are then removed, and the vagina is
drained with gauze introduced as far as the upper end of
the forceps.</p>

<p>The following are the advantages of the latter method
of operating:</p>

<p>If sterilization of the vagina and the cervix is not perfect,
the cleaner part of the operation is performed first.
The bladder is more easily separated from the uterus by
operating from above than by way of the vagina. The
vaginal vault is quickly and safely opened by incisions
made upon the gauze pads, which keep the intestines
out of the way.</p>

<p>The uterus and the infected cervix are removed through
the vagina, and not through the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p>If the operation is performed for cancer of the cervix,
the incision is made more accurately beyond the limits
of the disease if the vaginal vault is opened through the
vagina than if it is opened from above.</p>

<p>Werder, of Pittsburg, has advised the following combined
operation: The abdomen is opened, and the uterus,
tubes, and ovaries are freed as in ordinary hysterectomy.
The ureters are dissected out, and the uterine arteries
are ligated near their origin. The bladder is entirely
freed from the uterus, and also, for a considerable distance,
from the vagina. The recto-vaginal space is
then opened, and the posterior vaginal wall is stripped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
from the rectum as far down as necessary. The lateral
vaginal attachments are loosened. The uterus and
vagina are then pushed down into the pelvic outlet, and
the peritoneum from the anterior pelvic wall is united
with that covering the rectum, thus shutting off the
pelvis from the general peritoneal cavity and covering
all raw surfaces with peritoneum. The abdomen is then
closed.</p>

<p>The patient is then placed in the lithotomy position.
The uterus&mdash;which is found protruding at the vulva&mdash;is
seized with volsella forceps and drawn completely out of
the vulvar orifice with the inverted vagina. With the
finger in the rectum and the sound in the bladder as
safeguards against injuring these organs, the inverted
vagina is amputated with the knife or the thermo-cautery.
The chief advantage of this operation is that
a large vaginal cuff may be removed.</p>

<p><b id="ABDOMINAL_MYOMECTOMY">Abdominal Myomectomy.</b>&mdash;In some cases of uterine
fibroid it is proper to remove the tumor without taking
away the uterus. This operation&mdash;myomectomy&mdash;is performed
as follows:</p>

<p>The abdomen is opened by a free incision, the pelvis
is elevated, and the intestines are displaced from the
pelvic cavity in the usual manner. The tumor and the
uterus are surrounded by gauze sponges, and, where possible,
should be brought outside the abdominal cavity.
An incision is made around the pedicle or through the
capsule of the tumor, and it is enucleated by dissection
with the sharp or the blunt end of the scalpel. During
the operation hemorrhage may be controlled by an assistant,
who compresses with his fingers the vessels on each
side of the uterus, or by placing a temporary rubber ligature
about the cervix uteri.</p>

<p>Hemostasis is effected and the wound in the uterus is
closed by layers of continuous or interrupted catgut
sutures. Great care should be taken to prevent hemorrhage
between the layers of suture, and to insure accurate
closure of the incision in the uterus. The temporary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
ligature about the cervix, or the compression of
the vessels of the broad ligaments, should be removed
from time to time during the process of suturing and
after closure of the uterine wound, in order to determine
the position of bleeding points and the efficiency of the
hemostasis; and before closing the abdominal incision
the uterine wound should be inspected for several
minutes while the woman is in the horizontal position.</p>

<p>The abdomen may usually be closed without drainage.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>

<h3 id="THE_EFFECT_OF_THE_REMOVAL_OF_THE_UTERINE_APPENDAGES">THE EFFECT OF THE REMOVAL OF THE UTERINE APPENDAGES.</h3>

<p>Removal of the tube and ovary upon one side has no
effect upon menstruation or upon any of the other characteristics
of the woman.</p>

<p>Removal of the tubes and ovaries upon both sides is
followed within forty-eight hours by slight bleeding from
the uterus, lasting for one or two days.</p>

<p>If the removal of the tubes and ovaries has been complete,
menstruation, in the majority of cases, never reappears.</p>

<p>In a few cases menstruation appears for one, two, or
three periods after the operation, usually in diminished
amount, and then ceases for ever. In some other cases
there is a period of a few months of amenorrhea, followed
by two or three scanty menstrual flows, before the
bleeding permanently ceases.</p>

<p>These phenomena, it will be observed, are similar to
those of the normal menopause.</p>

<p>The woman after double salpingo-oöphorectomy experiences
the nervous and gastro-intestinal disturbances
that so usually accompany the menopause. She, in fact,
passes through a premature menopause, the phenomena
of which may persist for one or two years.</p>

<p>The secondary sexual characteristics of the woman&mdash;the
voice, the figure, and the growth of hair&mdash;are not altered
if the appendages are removed during adult life. The
case may be different if the appendages are removed in
the undeveloped girl, in whom the ovarian influence is
essential for complete development.</p>

<p>The woman loses none of her feminine attractions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
She may, indeed, become better-looking if the operation
has relieved chronic suffering. It is said that Gyges,
king of Lydia, caused the removal of ovaries from women
with a view to prolonging their charms.</p>

<p>Double oöphorectomy may be followed by obesity if
the woman have a tendency to form fat. The relief of
suffering and the consequent improved nutrition favor the
development of obesity. There seems to be nothing inherent
in the operation to cause it. Many women remain
thin after the operation.</p>

<p>The emotions of the woman are unaltered by double
oöphorectomy, with the exception of some cases in which
the sexual desire is destroyed. Sexual desire is dependent
upon such a variety of conditions, both within and
without the woman, that it is difficult to determine the
amount of influence that removal of the ovaries exerts
upon this feeling.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that sexual desire is sometimes
destroyed by the operation. On the other hand, the sexual
desire is very often restored by the operation, which
relieves the former dyspareunia, or painful coitus.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
